00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.719
Monal S: Hey, everyone. Good evening, good morning.

2
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.670
Monal S: Morning, guys, good morning.

3
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.159
Monal S: Good morning from Dubai. Yes, good morning from India. Thank you guys, thank you.

4
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.140
Monal S: How do I know VS Code is attached with a correct kernel version?

5
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.419
Monal S: Shantnu, at the end, I told you that,

6
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:07.440
Monal S: when we create that virtual environment, now we can create with a name. So that name will be populating on the kernel name. Name will be same as kernel name, alright?

7
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.430
Monal S: Just give me a second, Lance.

8
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:28.010
Monal S: Alright, so, Shantu, using that way, you will be able to understand that there is a correct kernel, okay? Good morning, guys, good morning, good morning.

9
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.739
Monal S: I hope everyone is doing well.

10
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.710
Monal S: Yes?

11
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.319
Monal S: Format is working, that's great.

12
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.580
Monal S: Then you know that is a correct kernel.

13
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.520
Monal S: Yes, yes. Saurup, I want to, but…

14
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.149
Monal S: Let's see what habit we will build. In every batch, we build habit based on how people feels like.

15
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.340
Monal S: You see him? Little dull? Yes, guys.

16
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.920
Monal S: A little less energy, but still…

17
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.010
Monal S: Excited to teach all of you.

18
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.159
Monal S: Alright, everyone, can we get started? Are you guys ready for today's class?

19
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.060
Monal S: I hope everyone knows what is today's agenda.

20
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.700
Monal S: Yes?

21
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.070
Monal S: Today is Python 2.

22
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.440
Monal S: Ready to rock? Yes.

23
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.370
Monal S: Alright, let me share my screen, and

24
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.750
Monal S: As usual, we will start with what are the things. Just let me…

25
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.530
Monal S: Yes, thank you very much, guys.

26
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.049
Monal S: You want to decrease brightness a bit. I really don't like white lights a lot.

27
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.880
Monal S: This feels good.

28
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.310
Monal S: Thank you very much, guys. Thank you, Ano.

29
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.100
Monal S: Okay.

30
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.630
Monal S: Today is 18th.

31
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.610
Monal S: of Jan 2026.

32
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.250
Monal S: today's agenda.

33
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.339
Monal S: We are learning Python again. It is only day 2.

34
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:13.090
Monal S: Yes, guys, we were able to solve everyone's issue. I have pasted the solution also on our community. Everyone's issue was able to solve, okay?

35
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.139
Monal S: In Python 2, there are things which we are going to learn. The first thing is string properties.

36
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.689
Monal S: I hope everyone now knows what is string. Yesterday, I told you what is a string. Yes?

37
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:38.139
Monal S: string properties, We are then going to again start operators, but now the advanced version of it, okay?

38
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.410
Monal S: Then… Control flow.

39
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:58.769
Monal S: Control flow is a concept, but in that concept, we have if-else, other things, alright? So we are going to take a look on that. Then, if you guys will be comfortable on that, I will tell you control flow 2. It means little bit of advance. Nested.

40
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.899
Monal S: nested, okay? This is simple, basic control flow, this is advanced control flow that is nested.

41
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:14.220
Monal S: Guys, we usually have two recordings because the class is getting longer, so it has to be splitted into two parts.

42
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.769
Monal S: Alright? Is my voice clear, everyone?

43
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:36.580
Monal S: Is my voice clear? Is my screen… nothing is flickering, everything is smooth? That's great. Guys, I'm confirming, everyone confirmed that. My voice is loud and clear. There is no issue with my… with my screen or my internet. Alright? So whoever is having issue, please do something on that. Yeah, thank you guys.

44
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:45.249
Monal S: Then, we'll talk about… maybe we can just have a discussion, or we can start based on the time that we have, non-primitive

45
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.720
Monal S: data type.

46
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.930
Monal S: Okay?

47
00:08:49.010 --> 00:09:05.079
Monal S: the data type that we have learned, we will call it as the Python data type of primitive data type, but I will talk about it, okay? These are the agenda. Is everyone clear? So whoever knows these concepts, they are free to leave and then enjoy the Sunday.

48
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:12.870
Monal S: They are weekend, but if you know all of this, feel free to stay, okay? Now, we are not going to do any installation. Installation is… everything is done.

49
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.290
Monal S: Alright, so we are just going to jump into the coding part. Alright? That's great. Now, let's get started.

50
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.520
Monal S: Okay, so the first thing is string properties. So let me write string properties.

51
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.730
Monal S: string… properties.

52
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.490
Monal S: Alright?

53
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:50.879
Monal S: So, we have seen that when we create characters, similar, like, data science, when we write some kind of a sentence, a word, or even a character, that comes with… when you check with the type, we will see something like this. How many of you remember this?

54
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:57.269
Monal S: When we check the type of it, we get something like this. Yes? Everyone remembers?

55
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:09.279
Monal S: Alright? So, whatever data type consists a class of STR comes with different, different methods. What is this? I told you, what do we call this?

56
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.640
Monal S: Recall that as a function. It does something.

57
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.950
Monal S: Yes?

58
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:21.500
Monal S: Just like print is a function, it's a function, we provide something in between, and it does the job.

59
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:34.829
Monal S: Yes, everyone knows the flow of the function. Function, we provide something, it does the job. Similarly, ID is a function, we provide something, it does some job. What are other functions which we have seen?

60
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:42.590
Monal S: Guys, I always provide the notes in the class resource and in the community as well.

61
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:51.230
Monal S: Yes, we have seen type as well. Type is also one of the functions, yes? So everyone is pretty comfortable with what function is.

62
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:59.939
Monal S: Yes, STR typecasting we have seen. We want to convert something. These are all typecasting things which we have seen.

63
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.970
Monal S: Yes, these all are functions. So let me write, all are functions.

64
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.970
Monal S: And because this is kind of the notes, just for the understanding, I'm going to keep it here.

65
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.100
Monal S: Alright? And let's keep everything here.

66
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:26.470
Monal S: Just give me a second… Alright.

67
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.720
Monal S: Better notes from the very start will help us build

68
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:51.210
Monal S: Is this good? Alright, so these are built-in functions. So, similarly, whenever something has, okay, there are other things than class. When we check the type.

69
00:11:51.300 --> 00:12:01.720
Monal S: class also comes with int float, but there are other things which does not have this class. So anything that has a class, anything that has a class also has properties.

70
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:13.449
Monal S: Alright? Anything that is of type class at the start comes with properties, and we will call those as methods.

71
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:26.220
Monal S: Are we clear? Functions, these are called as functions. Anything that is a class comes with its own properties. Properties are not common. Properties can be anything. I will talk about it. So, class…

72
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:36.920
Monal S: a class that is string comes with certain properties. Guys, I will talk about it. Okay, just let me tell you this example. House.

73
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.220
Monal S: Alright? House. What are the properties of house?

74
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.049
Monal S: What are the properties of house? House has doors.

75
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.460
Monal S: House has windows. Yes?

76
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.240
Monal S: House has windows. House has rooms.

77
00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:00.040
Monal S: So, think of house as class. House is a class.

78
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:11.569
Monal S: So, class always has some kind of a property. House has door, house has windows, house has rooms, house has floors.

79
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:26.140
Monal S: Similarly, what are functions? Think of functions as, like, just on a high-level overview, we are going to create our own class, but right now, we are using everything that Python gives us. What about functions? If I talk about function, function, let's suppose.

80
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.990
Monal S: A glass. Glass is a function. In glass, you pour water, you drink water from it.

81
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:39.959
Monal S: Are we clear? So, class is a standalone thing, standalone code, which does something. Class is…

82
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:49.329
Monal S: class is a compound, or you can say combinations of different functions. So, when we say string.

83
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:54.920
Monal S: When we say string, a string is a class. A string comes with its own properties.

84
00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:09.989
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand? Whenever we have a type, whenever we do something with type, if it comes with a class, it means it has some properties. And now we are going to look at those properties, alright? So, this is…

85
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.220
Monal S: String.

86
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.110
Monal S: Now, a string comes with its own properties.

87
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:23.799
Monal S: No, guys, class also comes in… if you print the integer flow, there also we have class.

88
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:31.239
Monal S: But right now, we are talking specifically about string, because there it provides more methods, more useful methods.

89
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.490
Monal S: Alright?

90
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.299
Monal S: Are we clear?

91
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.980
Monal S: Everyone, you will understand.

92
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.919
Monal S: So, string has methods like strip.

93
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.289
Monal S: String has methods like LSTRIP.

94
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.260
Monal S: String has methods like RString.

95
00:14:52.050 --> 00:15:03.680
Monal S: You will understand how we are using all of that, how to differentiate. Guys, functions and methods, we will talk about later, but for now, we will differentiate functions and methods.

96
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.829
Monal S: Think of function as standalone code.

97
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.090
Monal S: Think of method as… it's a part of some other block.

98
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.970
Monal S: This is… we will call this as method.

99
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.229
Monal S: We will call this as function.

100
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.870
Monal S: Is everyone able to visualize at least the difference between function and method?

101
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:34.350
Monal S: At least, are you able to visualize? So, if this is a string block, it will have multiple methods.

102
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.910
Monal S: Function can be… type is a function.

103
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.340
Monal S: It is a standalone thing.

104
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.600
Monal S: Alright?

105
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.590
Monal S: Guys, I will repeat again.

106
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.070
Monal S: I will repeat again.

107
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.350
Monal S: Okay?

108
00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:04.429
Monal S: Because I'm introducing the word of method, that's why a lot of people get confused, but if I started without even giving you the basics, it will be simpler.

109
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.110
Monal S: Okay, see this.

110
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:21.910
Monal S: Now, guys, don't worry about the difference. Understand how we use it, okay? Understand how we use it. See this. First, I will give you a demo, then you will understand, alright? Everyone?

111
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.550
Monal S: It's fine, guys.

112
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.570
Monal S: Say this.

113
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.799
Monal S: This is our lectures.

114
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:50.309
Monal S: This is our lectures, and in this lecture, what I'm going to do, this zip, I have already provided to all of you, I'm going to delete it, and in this lecture, I'm going to create a new folder where we'll be doing today's coding. 18012026. No one should say, sir, I don't know how to create these folders and others. This is already completed.

115
00:16:51.700 --> 00:17:01.249
Monal S: Guys, you will see that, you will see that. See this. I'm going to create a new file, I'm going to rename it as 18012026.ipynb.

116
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.330
Monal S: Nope.

117
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.720
Monal S: Everyone, focus.

118
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.509
Monal S: So what I'm drawing…

119
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:14.039
Monal S: This is level 1 I've selected, and in the markdown, I will be starting first string operations.

120
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.670
Monal S: Alright.

121
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:23.830
Monal S: So, see this. When I do type, this is in Markdown, I need code block.

122
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.880
Monal S: when I do type of 1, I am getting int.

123
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.150
Monal S: When I'm getting type of data, a string.

124
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:47.199
Monal S: I'm getting this. Now let's print it, because sometimes a lot of the functionality gets hidden. Now this looks better.

125
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.350
Monal S: So, are we able to understand the functionality of type?

126
00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:00.090
Monal S: Type, you provide something, it gives you data. It gives you answer. Is this part clear?

127
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.140
Monal S: Is this part clear? Everyone?

128
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.250
Monal S: Alright.

129
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.730
Monal S: So now, see this data. Tell me what is this data type of this string?

130
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.860
Monal S: What is this? This is what?

131
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.099
Monal S: What should we call this?

132
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.760
Monal S: This is a string.

133
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:28.119
Monal S: Now see what I'm doing. Now see what I'm doing. As I mentioned, string is what? String is a class. Yes?

134
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.190
Monal S: A string is a class itself.

135
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:41.030
Monal S: If I talk about this type, type is what? Type is a function. This value which we're talking about is a string, it is class. Now, see what I'm doing.

136
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.210
Monal S: Let me write…

137
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.410
Monal S: Are we able to see there are a lot of spaces?

138
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:58.940
Monal S: Front and and… Are you able to see a lot of spaces, front and end?

139
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.239
Monal S: Alright, now see the output.

140
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.110
Monal S: In the string, I'm using something called as dot.

141
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.569
Monal S: then I'm using its function, its method.

142
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.670
Monal S: Are we able to see any spaces now?

143
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.820
Monal S: Are we able to see any spaces?

144
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:25.230
Monal S: So this is a class called a string, and we are using its own property.

145
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.540
Monal S: Its own property is called as method.

146
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:37.800
Monal S: Is this a different property? Can I use a strip? See this. Strip is not a function. If I provide strip and provide data science, it will not work.

147
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.809
Monal S: It is giving you error here itself. Are you able to see?

148
00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.920
Monal S: Because it is not a function.

149
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.279
Monal S: It's a property of… string itself.

150
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.299
Monal S: So, a property of something is called as method.

151
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:59.169
Monal S: But a standalone thing, standalone thing which does some job is called as function.

152
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.169
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

153
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.399
Monal S: The standalone thing, which does some job, is called as function.

154
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:17.020
Monal S: something which is a part of another thing that is a string, right? Here, it is a part of… this is a property… strip is a property of string.

155
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.589
Monal S: If I apply 1.strip, it will not work.

156
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:27.750
Monal S: Because 1 is integer, strip is a property of… guys, tell me. Strip is a property of…

157
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:35.279
Monal S: Strip is a property of… correct. Everyone is not correct. Strip is a property of string.

158
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:53.699
Monal S: If I run it, it will say invalid, it does not know this is a integer, it does not know what this property is. That's why it is creating error. But if I enclose one with double quotes, make it as a string, it will work, it will not do anything, because everything is correct.

159
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.870
Monal S: So is everyone able to understand this part which I was talking about?

160
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.969
Monal S: Certain class has certain properties.

161
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:09.200
Monal S: Your car is a class, has property like drive.

162
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.150
Monal S: Open door.

163
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:19.510
Monal S: Your house is another class, but does house have a property of drive?

164
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.809
Monal S: Does house has a property of drive?

165
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.030
Monal S: No.

166
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.540
Monal S: How's will I have lived rooms, etc.

167
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.530
Monal S: If I talk about door alone, door alone, very small component.

168
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.419
Monal S: Indoor, we provide something, it gets something.

169
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:48.080
Monal S: That's all. Door does not have any property. What we call that in Python, in programming language, what are we going to call this?

170
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.949
Monal S: What are we going to call this? A function.

171
00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:02.929
Monal S: Is everyone clear between function and properties? Properties and methods, okay? We say these are methods, but methods of some class.

172
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.130
Monal S: Are we clear?

173
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.300
Monal S: I will write in comments, not a function.

174
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.690
Monal S: Alright? And then here, little confusing, guys, what is confusing? Tell me.

175
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:25.170
Monal S: Here, I will call it as… A strip is, property of string.

176
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.199
Monal S: Bhavan, we can say that, but right now, I'm just giving example.

177
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.990
Monal S: Alright.

178
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.170
Monal S: Methods and functions, guys.

179
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.640
Monal S: Guys, no doubt.

180
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.330
Monal S: Now, note this down.

181
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.409
Monal S: If I don't give you a definition, you guys will not understand.

182
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.330
Monal S: Methods.

183
00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:04.420
Monal S: Property of something is… Called a method.

184
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.310
Monal S: Okay?

185
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.259
Monal S: Property of something is called a method function.

186
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.170
Monal S: You can see…

187
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.090
Monal S: does something.

188
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.120
Monal S: Okay? Does some job.

189
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:40.279
Monal S: Function does some job, method also does some job, but method… the main thing about method is, method can only be utilized against its own property, like a string.

190
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.730
Monal S: Alright? So if I talk about class of string.

191
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.649
Monal S: Everyone see this. I am again repeating.

192
00:23:47.150 --> 00:24:02.630
Monal S: A string has its own property. Property, think in terms of property. Don't consider method as a word. String has certain properties. Properties of strip, properties of L strip, properties of r strip.

193
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.259
Monal S: Integer, on the other hand, does not have a strip.

194
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:17.160
Monal S: Alright? Integer, on the other hand, does not have these properties, so we cannot use strip with integer.

195
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.180
Monal S: Is this part clear? What properties are…

196
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:28.019
Monal S: Is this part clear? Don't forget about function for now. Are we clear, everyone? Are we clear what is a property?

197
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.580
Monal S: Property is tightly coupled with its own class.

198
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:39.790
Monal S: Classes, string, Its own data type. Think of that as its own data type.

199
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.849
Monal S: Depends on data type.

200
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.440
Monal S: Alright?

201
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.100
Monal S: What is a function?

202
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.940
Monal S: What is a function?

203
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.949
Monal S: Function does not have… function is not coup… okay.

204
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:07.499
Monal S: function, not… Related to data type.

205
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:19.550
Monal S: Function is not related to data type. Function job is… It does something.

206
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:29.419
Monal S: Alright? Yes. Right now, if I say block of code, then people will say, what is a block? Alright?

207
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.070
Monal S: So, say this? Here, what I'm doing, ID.

208
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:38.790
Monal S: If I say ID of a variable, A is equal to 2. If I provide A,

209
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:47.830
Monal S: What we are doing, what we are doing, we are asking this piece of code, which we have seen, and does something.

210
00:25:47.930 --> 00:26:03.900
Monal S: Does it have… are we using anything like dot or something? If we are not using anything like dot or something, which we were using before, it means it is not a method. Only consider that whenever we use dot against something, it is called as method.

211
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:20.759
Monal S: Whenever we are using something like dot, it is a method. When we are not using dot, it is a function. When we are going into object-oriented programming, then you will understand the main difference between function and method, but right now, I just wanted to tell properties of… properties of…

212
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:30.749
Monal S: data, that is a string, int float is called as method. If we don't use that property that is dot, it means it is not a method. Function, it does something.

213
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.710
Monal S: Alright? Here, what it is doing?

214
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:49.430
Monal S: does something… But… only… for its… own data type.

215
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.830
Monal S: Alright?

216
00:26:54.380 --> 00:27:01.439
Monal S: Guys, tell me, okay, people are asking, can't we call a function with a dot to perform something? See this. This is ID.

217
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.300
Monal S: Can I call A.ID? Let's see.

218
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.350
Monal S: Is it working?

219
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.349
Monal S: It means ID is not a property of variable.

220
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.500
Monal S: It means ID is not a property of…

221
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.920
Monal S: Integer. Are we able to understand?

222
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.290
Monal S: Guys, ID is not a property of integer. Are we able to understand?

223
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.590
Monal S: Yes, devices.

224
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:36.169
Monal S: So don't complicate too much, just understand that when we use dot, it is a property of something.

225
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.420
Monal S: ID is a function. Function cannot be used with dot.

226
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.149
Monal S: Function cannot be used with a dot.

227
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.920
Monal S: Alright, so let me write…

228
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:56.500
Monal S: Cannot be used with this dot.

229
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.700
Monal S: Hey, Ed?

230
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:06.780
Monal S: we use dot… To call its property.

231
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.250
Monal S: Don't worry, guys, you will get familiar.

232
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:17.340
Monal S: Okay? You will get familiar. Alright? So, now let's get started on this end part.

233
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:28.429
Monal S: Guys, property and methods. Yes, property and methods is same, I'm just using it interchangeably, okay? Method is the main technical term, property is what, we use it as a concept.

234
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.369
Monal S: Yes, yes, Sanjit.

235
00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:43.139
Monal S: Sanjit, do you mind not really doing all of that, I'm able to read it.

236
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.550
Monal S: property, Vikram. Alright. So, let's create a variable name.

237
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:58.889
Monal S: Okay, let's create a variable name, and here I have monol, S, and a lot of spaces.

238
00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.329
Monal S: And a lot of spaces. The first property which we will do is…

239
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:22.070
Monal S: The first property which we will do is, it's called a strip. A strip is a property of a string, this is something which you need to remember, alright? Now, if I apply name.strip, name.strip, what it does? What it does? It removes, it removes spaces.

240
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:30.179
Monal S: From right and left side of the… right and left side of the string.

241
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.069
Monal S: Is this part here known?

242
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:50.280
Monal S: When we use name.strip, it removes spaces. I have spaces, this is empty space. Here I have space, no space. But it… the main job of this method is to remove spaces from left and right side of the string.

243
00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.710
Monal S: And now, see what I will do? I will save it again back to name.

244
00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.760
Monal S: So whatever is removed, I will save it again, and let's print and see what happens.

245
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.430
Monal S: Print name.

246
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.860
Monal S: Name is not defined because I need to run this cell.

247
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:18.020
Monal S: Is it working? Are we able to see any space? See, when you select it, you will see the actual, actual text. Are you able to see that space?

248
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.350
Monal S: Everyone?

249
00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.580
Monal S: Panic departs.

250
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.270
Monal S: Alright?

251
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:40.779
Monal S: Guys, don't go too much in depth. Right now, when we learn object-oriented programming, then we will understand. But I am… I'm giving you at least some information that you can relate later. Just use dot strip with a string, for now.

252
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.090
Monal S: Alright?

253
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.290
Monal S: Okay?

254
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.280
Monal S: You will understand later.

255
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.400
Monal S: Name.strip. Now, there is another function called as lstrip.

256
00:30:53.660 --> 00:31:00.999
Monal S: It is… L strict, okay? But before writing anything, let me conclude so that we know the actual concept.

257
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:17.320
Monal S: To remove white spaces, To remove white spaces from string, we use… Below matters.

258
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:24.129
Monal S: Everyone know when I say methods. It means it belongs to a certain data type, alright? First is L strip.

259
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:33.069
Monal S: L strip means removes… a space… From left side.

260
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.899
Monal S: Only left side. Is this part clear?

261
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.300
Monal S: Similarly, we have Rstrip. How many of you are able to guess it? What RStrip is going to do?

262
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.369
Monal S: What RStip is going to do?

263
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:53.250
Monal S: Removes… a space from… Right side. Correct. Right side.

264
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.120
Monal S: And then we only have strip.

265
00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:03.109
Monal S: A strip is a combination of L strip, plus R strict.

266
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.950
Monal S: It removes left, it removes light, and it makes it as a string.

267
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.010
Monal S: Are we clear? Is everyone clear?

268
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.320
Monal S: Alright? So, say this.

269
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:30.950
Monal S: Again, I'm going to… let's create a new name, okay? Let's create a new name. Here, I have only on the left side. Okay, I have on the both side, and this time I will use… I will not save it back to name.

270
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.340
Monal S: But we will be able to print it.

271
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.390
Monal S: name.rstrip.

272
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:47.720
Monal S: If I select it, are we able to see the left space is still left, but the right part is gone? Yes?

273
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.829
Monal S: Are we able to see this?

274
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.530
Monal S: Great.

275
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.290
Monal S: Similarly, I will show you our strip now.

276
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.960
Monal S: Our strip.

277
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.980
Monal S: And this time, okay, this was already R script, now we will show you L shift.

278
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.710
Monal S: Now, only the left side space will be removed, our side space, we will see, okay?

279
00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:15.679
Monal S: Let me select it. Are we able to see? Left side is gone, right side is here.

280
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.350
Monal S: Are you able to see this?

281
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.400
Monal S: Yes?

282
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:30.980
Monal S: Guys, right now, we are not able to see the string, because this is how it works in Notebook. If I remove this…

283
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:35.199
Monal S: Then we will see this… The single quotes.

284
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:42.149
Monal S: But if I use print, as I mentioned, print does not have these codes. Print just uses values.

285
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:51.980
Monal S: So if you don't want to use print, let me comment it so you guys can refer it later. It will show you what is going on with those comps.

286
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:59.009
Monal S: This is a behavior of notebook, but in reality, you will not get these quotes when you run in terminal.

287
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.590
Monal S: Alright?

288
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.789
Monal S: Are we clear? Guys, we have to remember all of this behavior.

289
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:20.610
Monal S: Alright? Is everyone clear now? If you don't know Strip, can you make Strip? How many of you will be able to create a strip if they only know RStrip and L strip?

290
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:27.690
Monal S: How many of you will be able to remove complete spaces from left and right without using strip?

291
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.250
Monal S: I will tell you how.

292
00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:42.230
Monal S: The problem statement is remove space from… both side… from both sides, without using… strip.

293
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:55.909
Monal S: So, what we will do, we will first take the variable, everyone, we will first take the variable, alright? Then, here what we will do, name is equals to name.lstrip.

294
00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.250
Monal S: This will remove. Guys, this will remove.

295
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.570
Monal S: the left space.

296
00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:08.029
Monal S: Alright, next. Don't worry, I will make it, I will merge it as well.

297
00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:14.039
Monal S: Then, I will do R strip, save it back to name.

298
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.350
Monal S: If I print name, what will happen? If I print name, what will happen?

299
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:25.109
Monal S: Both left side is removed, right side is removed, and we will just see the complete string.

300
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.079
Monal S: Are we clear?

301
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.010
Monal S: Are we clear?

302
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:39.390
Monal S: Another method, another way to do it, simpler, without using all of this code, what we can do, I will copy it.

303
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.989
Monal S: Here, I will use R string.

304
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.690
Monal S: And that's it.

305
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.530
Monal S: Name.lstrip.rstrip, done.

306
00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.290
Monal S: Say this.

307
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:57.449
Monal S: Still working It's still working, now I will tell you how.

308
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:07.040
Monal S: Guys, I will tell you, first, understand ABCD of programming. The more we know what we can do, the better we will understand when to use it.

309
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.699
Monal S: Say this. On this code, how to read it?

310
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.279
Monal S: Name is…

311
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:20.220
Monal S: Let's suppose name is data, and we have a lot of spaces. Here we have a space, here we have a space.

312
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.960
Monal S: This is name.

313
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.710
Monal S: When we provide name here, name will be… data.

314
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.610
Monal S: What we are asking Python to do? Name.lstrip.

315
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:43.679
Monal S: what it will do, it will remove the left side, and we will be left with… and we will be left with this part of data. Yes?

316
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.810
Monal S: Is this part done?

317
00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:47.790
Monal S: Is this part done?

318
00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:57.470
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand? Now, what is the… what is the value of… what is the value of this operation?

319
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.679
Monal S: This operation value is this.

320
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.889
Monal S: What we are doing on this value?

321
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.490
Monal S: dot r strip.

322
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:12.810
Monal S: So this value.rstrip will give you… data.

323
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:20.020
Monal S: Alright guys, it also happens like this.

324
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.530
Monal S: Now, this is a great question which people are asking.

325
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.390
Monal S: People are asking that.

326
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:32.510
Monal S: Will it not work right to left? Why is it working left to right? Yes?

327
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.529
Monal S: Say this, everyone?

328
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:40.599
Monal S: So… First of all, this code execution happens from top to bottom.

329
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.769
Monal S: and right to left. This part is correct. We are doing right to left here, but within this, this is a whole code statement.

330
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:56.409
Monal S: If I start from here, do I have even the variable to perform?

331
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.160
Monal S: Do I even have the variable where I have to perform?

332
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:14.790
Monal S: Variable is starting from here, guys. So, when we have operation, within operation, this is right to left is done. Now, within right, we have some sentence. Similarly, happens, like, in the print statement.

333
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:33.400
Monal S: Okay? Variable is there. What Python does internally, it first solves whatever things it can solve. If A is equal to 12, then it will replace the A and reduce the complexity. Once the complexity is reduced, then it will do its job.

334
00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:39.870
Monal S: So here, name will be replaced with its value, then it will start doing its job.

335
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.079
Monal S: Are you clear?

336
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:48.049
Monal S: So start from the variable, then property, then what property is next?

337
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.960
Monal S: Alright?

338
00:38:54.130 --> 00:39:01.249
Monal S: There is a space between… alright, alright, see guys, when we talk about this space, alright, the space in between.

339
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.500
Monal S: Strip is not meant. Guys, when we talk about strip, strip only means from the end.

340
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:14.790
Monal S: A strip does not remove space from here, a strip only removes space from the end of the string.

341
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:23.039
Monal S: Guys, you can use R strip, then L strip, totally fine.

342
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.510
Monal S: What you are trying to do is totally depends on you.

343
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:39.210
Monal S: You can also use R strip and L strip, what difference it will make. First, focus on what exactly it is used for. I have reduced the remove… I have reduced the right side, then I will reduce the left side.

344
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.460
Monal S: Rahul, not here.

345
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.820
Monal S: All right?

346
00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.739
Monal S: Alright, very simple.

347
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.870
Monal S: Very simple.

348
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.289
Monal S: Is it simple or not?

349
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.899
Monal S: Muhammad, don't worry about right-to-left execution.

350
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.480
Monal S: Just understand, line by line.

351
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:23.670
Monal S: Right, to left, and if right is a complex code, then within it, it will start from left to right.

352
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.410
Monal S: Are we clear?

353
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.350
Monal S: Line by line, that is top to bottom.

354
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:38.210
Monal S: Then, within top to bottom, we have 3 major components. 1, 2, 3.

355
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:53.469
Monal S: This value should be going, that is, assignment operator going to the name. Now, if this is a complex system, now we will… Python will start solving it, and to solve it, it requires value. Where is the value? This is the value. What operation? This is the operation.

356
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:58.290
Monal S: This will give you new value. New value, what operation? L string.

357
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:12.589
Monal S: Alright? So this completes the first part that we have talked about, that is string properties. In future, there are a lot of properties, guys, which we are going to learn, but this is the introduction of what we will be able to do.

358
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:27.949
Monal S: Yes, that is another property, Mustan, that's what they were talking about, yes? So, guys, these are not just only properties, string has more properties, but we'll talk about that in future. If you want to see those properties, I will show you.

359
00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:30.880
Monal S: Right?

360
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.530
Monal S: dust wait.

361
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.980
Monal S: Let me see if I'm able to see that.

362
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.050
Monal S: Because for it to select.

363
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.410
Monal S: Wait, okay?

364
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.640
Monal S: Let me see if I'm able to open all of that. Okay.

365
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:56.929
Monal S: Don't worry about all of this code, okay? Don't worry about it, but are we able to see STR

366
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.619
Monal S: Are we able to see STR?

367
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:12.250
Monal S: Alright, now see all of these properties of SDR. Here, you will also find our split

368
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.610
Monal S: R strip, are you able to see our strip?

369
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.380
Monal S: Yes?

370
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:32.260
Monal S: R strip is there. Similarly, you can see there are lots of properties of strip. Not everything, but there are a lot of properties. But for now, we want to just get familiar with few of them. Strip, L strip, R strip.

371
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:38.240
Monal S: Now, what is the use case? I will tell you what is the use case. Suppose you are a developer.

372
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:47.240
Monal S: Suppose you are a developer, You will be developer, alright? You are a developer.

373
00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.769
Monal S: And you are collecting data from Google Form.

374
00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:58.349
Monal S: You are collecting data from people, Google from, alright? And you have seen in coding that

375
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:06.349
Monal S: If I talk about data, data is not same as this data. Data is not same as this data.

376
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:13.249
Monal S: And data is not same as this data, this one has space.

377
00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.829
Monal S: Do we agree? Do we agree?

378
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.260
Monal S: Everyone?

379
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:34.669
Monal S: Agree? So, it is not same. So, in some of the fields, if I'm asking some people age, okay, I am asking people age. If they pass 27, 28, 40, 50, it is fine.

380
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:54.730
Monal S: I can use… I can use, if they are passing a string, how to convert to number? Guys, if they are passing a string, can we convert this to a number? We have seen yesterday using typecasting. I can just pass int and the value of a string of 27, it will give me 27, which is a number.

381
00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:07.989
Monal S: But if they pass me 27 space, now this int does not know what to do with the space. It will not be able to convert. So before passing to here, what we will do.

382
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:16.030
Monal S: Before passing here, what we will do? Can we pass… 27 to first strip.

383
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:22.050
Monal S: Then we can pass the answer of this to the integer. Can we do that?

384
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:29.089
Monal S: This string.strip, it will provide a new value, without the spaces.

385
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.190
Monal S: When we pass to integer, will it fix it?

386
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.910
Monal S: Will it fix? It will fix.

387
00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:42.369
Monal S: Alright? So, we will learn. People are asking that what happens if there is a space between this?

388
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.740
Monal S: We will learn more methods that time.

389
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:51.560
Monal S: We will learn more methods that time, but for now, we are not going to learn it, alright? Keep it simple.

390
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.839
Monal S: Keep it simple. Everyone now knows the use case.

391
00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.180
Monal S: Everyone clear with the use case?

392
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:03.599
Monal S: No, methods are used for a lot of things, alright?

393
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.190
Monal S: This method is nothing but property.

394
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.059
Monal S: Okay? Method is nothing but property.

395
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.120
Monal S: Later in the class, we will… we will learn to create our own class.

396
00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:28.699
Monal S: We will learn to create our own class and methods, we will create our own, not just Python. This one, Python is giving. We will create more of our own, but that is advanced part, not now.

397
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.649
Monal S: Alright? So let's jump to the next part.

398
00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:39.109
Monal S: I know this took more time, but the main part is everyone should be able to understand text. Operators, too.

399
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:46.229
Monal S: Alright? What is the one operator which we have already learned? Tell me. What is the one operator which we have already learned?

400
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.300
Monal S: operators.

401
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:56.840
Monal S: We have already completed arithmetic operators.

402
00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.139
Monal S: This is already done.

403
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.240
Monal S: What was the next one in the list?

404
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.139
Monal S: Can someone tell me what was the next one in the list?

405
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.589
Monal S: If you go to less study lecture, you will be able to see what we were talking about

406
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:23.050
Monal S: Where is it? I hope everyone is completing their assignments. I have given the assignment.

407
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:30.490
Monal S: Alright? The next one is relational operators. Very, very, very important.

408
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.100
Monal S: All the operators are important, alright?

409
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.889
Monal S: So, let me give you that example.

410
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:41.880
Monal S: Yes.

411
00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.920
Monal S: Just wait.

412
00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:52.440
Monal S: Fuck it.

413
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.619
Monal S: Relational, alright? We will go with relational.

414
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:05.439
Monal S: Next, we have is… Relational operator.

415
00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:13.759
Monal S: Relational operator is also called as comparison operator.

416
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.779
Monal S: It has two names.

417
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.060
Monal S: Comparison operator, and you will understand why.

418
00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:27.790
Monal S: Okay? You will understand why. So now, let's go to this page. Here, I will write whatever things we have completed on the operator, and now I will write relational.

419
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.600
Monal S: Very simple.

420
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:44.640
Monal S: Everyone knows how to communicate this in real world in our own language, but now we will understand the language of programming.

421
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.709
Monal S: What is the relationship between 12 and 3?

422
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:59.460
Monal S: Tell me, what is the relationship between 12 and 3? Is 12 bigger, 3 smaller, both of them are equal? What is the relationship in terms of numbers?

423
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.200
Monal S: 12 is greater than 3.

424
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.369
Monal S: What is the relationship between 12 and 12?

425
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.760
Monal S: They are equal. But can I write equal in our coding?

426
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:20.339
Monal S: Equal is assignment operator. So, encoding, to tell something is equal, we use double equals to.

427
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.720
Monal S: What is the relationship between 3 and 12?

428
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.330
Monal S: What is the relationship between 3 and 12?

429
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.479
Monal S: 3 is smaller than 12.

430
00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.300
Monal S: Yes?

431
00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:37.800
Monal S: This is done.

432
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:44.510
Monal S: Alright? This part is done. Now… Another one, okay?

433
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:54.890
Monal S: So, if I need to find… What is the relationship between Okay.

434
00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:09.279
Monal S: Alright, these are the basic operators. This means… greater than… This means… equals… This means… A smaller than…

435
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:25.280
Monal S: Now, because we are dealing with… because we are dealing with coding, we will get some more type of situations. We might face a situation where, if I talk about 10, I don't want to understand between 10 and… okay.

436
00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:30.820
Monal S: greater.

437
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.929
Monal S: Then, OR equals 2.

438
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:44.299
Monal S: If I want to solve this kind of a condition, where I want to find whether certain number is greater than or equals to.

439
00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.300
Monal S: How many of you have heard this? This we all use.

440
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:53.460
Monal S: If I want a situation where I need to tell something is greater than or equals to.

441
00:49:53.630 --> 00:50:00.500
Monal S: It means it should be either greater or equals. In both the condition, it should be…

442
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:03.590
Monal S: It should solve us, it should give us.

443
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.210
Monal S: Alright? So…

444
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:11.539
Monal S: In this kind of cases, we use something called as 12 is greater than or equals to 3.

445
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.479
Monal S: Are we clear? This is also true.

446
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:22.010
Monal S: 12 is. Now, if I want to solve a condition where I will say smaller than or equals to.

447
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.529
Monal S: Smaller than or equals 2.

448
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:34.409
Monal S: is smaller than or equals 2. I will write 3 is smaller than or equals to 12.

449
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.490
Monal S: Is this also correct?

450
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.870
Monal S: Is this also correct?

451
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:49.420
Monal S: Finally, another operator which tells us, if I want to understand whether something is not equals to something.

452
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:55.139
Monal S: Don't worry, everything will get cleared. When to use it, where to use it. NOT equals 2.

453
00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:02.270
Monal S: In Python, we use something like this. This we call it as NOT, this will be equals to.

454
00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:07.030
Monal S: So, is 3 not equals to 12? Yes, correct.

455
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:17.560
Monal S: Now, I will tell you where and how to use it. Relational operators will tell you relation… off…

456
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.189
Monal S: two values.

457
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.230
Monal S: Alright? Relation of two values.

458
00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.469
Monal S: And we use operator…

459
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:45.209
Monal S: And we use operator… to check… If… It is… True or not.

460
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:53.569
Monal S: True or not is the final goal. So, true or not means True or false?

461
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.110
Monal S: Now, everyone will answer with me.

462
00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:58.299
Monal S: Everyone will answer Mitvi.

463
00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:04.220
Monal S: First value, second value, alright? Everyone will answer with me. Very simple.

464
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:08.400
Monal S: 12 greater than 3. 2 or false?

465
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.420
Monal S: 12 greater than 3. True or false? True.

466
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:17.330
Monal S: 12 is smaller than 3. True or false?

467
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:20.710
Monal S: False!

468
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:25.559
Monal S: 12, greater than or equal to 3.

469
00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:27.850
Monal S: True or false?

470
00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:44.969
Monal S: Yes, it is not equal, but it is greater than. As I told you, either one of them should be present. It is not equals to 3, 12 is not equals to 3, but here we have 2 operators. Is it greater than? Yes. True.

471
00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:49.219
Monal S: Is 12 smaller than or equal to 3?

472
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.080
Monal S: Is it 12?

473
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.040
Monal S: Is… now, this one is tricky.

474
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.040
Monal S: Age 12, Naught equals to 12.

475
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:18.600
Monal S: This is how you should solve it, because at the very start, when we start coding, it kind of gives us confusion. So, think of this as opposed of equals.

476
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:25.920
Monal S: Solve this as… Opposite of double equal.

477
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:33.480
Monal S: So, let's solve double equal. Is 12 equals to 12? Tell me. Is 12 equals to 12?

478
00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:34.380
Monal S: True.

479
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.089
Monal S: Opposite of true is?

480
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:39.159
Monal S: Opposite of true ways?

481
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.550
Monal S: False.

482
00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.889
Monal S: And what is opposite? Opposite is not.

483
00:53:45.620 --> 00:54:05.569
Monal S: So, when we say 12 not equals to 12, the answer is false. It means we are asking, is this number not equals to this number? No. This number, no. See, the first what I said is, is this number not equals to this number? The first thing is, no. Comma.

484
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:08.070
Monal S: This is equal.

485
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.429
Monal S: Are you able to understand?

486
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:15.140
Monal S: Guys, don't answer in the community chat, alright?

487
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:17.560
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand?

488
00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:26.050
Monal S: Final, tell me, is 3 equals to 3?

489
00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.520
Monal S: True or false?

490
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.540
Monal S: Again, I'm just cross-cautioning everyone, okay?

491
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.580
Monal S: Is 3 greater than or equal to 3?

492
00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:48.259
Monal S: Someone said no, and someone said false. I was looking. Guys, 3 is not greater than 3, that is…

493
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:54.159
Monal S: False. 3 greater than 3? False. But here we have two things.

494
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.220
Monal S: Either of them should be correct.

495
00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:02.599
Monal S: 3 is not greater, but 3 is equals, so that is true, that's why I'm asking question.

496
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:07.209
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand all of this?

497
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:09.080
Monal S: Everyone.

498
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:15.310
Monal S: Now, let's con… let's take this into our code. This is 18…

499
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:20.900
Monal S: And here, we will write operators. What operators we are learning currently?

500
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.760
Monal S: what operators?

501
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:28.880
Monal S: Relational operators, guys, arithmetic is already done. Relational operators.

502
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:34.130
Monal S: And I want to make it small, so this one, okay?

503
00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.330
Monal S: Relational, see this, when to use it?

504
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:51.239
Monal S: I have variable A, I have variable A called as 100. Let's say 100. This is Marlborne, let me select Python. Don't worry, you will learn to navigate all of that. I have another value called as 200.

505
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.430
Monal S: Alright?

506
00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:58.840
Monal S: Now, let's see this operation. I will print one by one. I will print each one by one to understand the value.

507
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.630
Monal S: Alright?

508
00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:07.059
Monal S: I will write A greater than B, small a, because capital A does not exist.

509
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.700
Monal S: Correct?

510
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.250
Monal S: Is this correct?

511
00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:18.370
Monal S: Now, I want all of you, I will write a few things, I want all of you

512
00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:22.269
Monal S: To understand, we already know the behavior, I already repeated it.

513
00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:26.859
Monal S: This is how we do encoding.

514
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:41.010
Monal S: I'm giving you one… I'm giving you a few seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, to understand

515
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:47.329
Monal S: And understand each of everything, why the output is coming. We all know the answer, I just want you to look at it.

516
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:49.310
Monal S: 30 seconds, guys.

517
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:54.640
Monal S: If you're able to understand, say, done.

518
00:56:54.910 --> 00:57:02.930
Monal S: In the chat We've already done this in our notebook, in our… when I was… where I was writing.

519
00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.500
Monal S: Pretty simple.

520
00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:07.440
Monal S: Pretty simple.

521
00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.250
Monal S: Alright.

522
00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.810
Monal S: Similarly.

523
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:27.540
Monal S: If A is data, B is… data space.

524
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:34.739
Monal S: And let me zoom in, and if I write FA, is equals… not if, sorry.

525
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.280
Monal S: We're introducing new thing.

526
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.510
Monal S: Bad habit.

527
00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:48.830
Monal S: 4 should be false, 1, 2, 3, 4. Why this one should be false?

528
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:56.180
Monal S: Let's see if I… if I write it like 100 is smaller than or equals to 200.

529
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.150
Monal S: It is true, guys.

530
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.710
Monal S: It is true.

531
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:09.270
Monal S: Okay?

532
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:22.820
Monal S: Okay, so now tell me, all of this we were doing with numbers. With numbers, it makes sense. Greater than, smaller than.

533
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:26.709
Monal S: Greater than or equals to, smaller than or equals to.

534
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:33.569
Monal S: Does it make sense, in terms of string, that this data is greater than this data?

535
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.559
Monal S: Does it make sense?

536
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:38.200
Monal S: No.

537
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:43.570
Monal S: But… Can we use one of the operators which makes sense?

538
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:48.289
Monal S: If both of the strings are equal or not, yes.

539
00:58:52.250 --> 00:59:04.089
Monal S: Just going to give you one very simple example, which you guys can relate. Let's suppose this is our ID. This is our ID, okay? Your ID is 123. Your password is…

540
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.629
Monal S: Your password is… Hello, 1, 2, 3. Or let's say hello world.

541
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:15.759
Monal S: Now, you can create a system, you can create a system to check if ID.

542
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:32.920
Monal S: I'm just giving you in future things, alright? Or let's just write in print, if ID is equals to whatever your actual ID is. You can later take it, but are you able to at least visualize? Let's suppose our ID should be equals to 100. If it is not, it will give us false.

543
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:44.380
Monal S: If our password If our password is not equals to… Krishnak Academy.

544
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.409
Monal S: Then we will give false.

545
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:54.830
Monal S: It means password is not matching, ID is not matching. Is everyone able to relate?

546
00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.129
Monal S: Is everyone able to relate? And guys, good question, see this.

547
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.379
Monal S: This is giving us blue.

548
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:09.090
Monal S: Yes, but the password is white. But if I use ID underscore, it is white.

549
01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:14.799
Monal S: I told you it is not a good thing to write keywords as a variable name.

550
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:22.510
Monal S: Are we clear? So we can make it as ID underscore, which is not a keyword. Now it is turning to white.

551
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:32.309
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand the future use case? Future is not that simple, guys. It will have lot of things, but at least are you getting the direction?

552
01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:44.069
Monal S: Where can we use it, what can we do? Or suppose you are creating your own system where you don't want people, let's say you want age threshold.

553
01:00:44.810 --> 01:01:03.270
Monal S: age threshold is equals to 18. You don't want people, so suppose if some person 1, person 1 age is 16. They are logging in in your system, like Facebook system or something, what you will first check? You will first check whether the person is

554
01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:13.320
Monal S: person threshold age is correct. So, if person age is smaller than age threshold.

555
01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.559
Monal S: Then we will not them log in.

556
01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.980
Monal S: Then we will not… not let that person log into our system.

557
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:23.329
Monal S: Only, see this, person age is smaller.

558
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.849
Monal S: Or we can… here, we can say…

559
01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:31.150
Monal S: If person age is greater than or equal to, then only we will let them log in.

560
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.230
Monal S: Logging is full. When the person will become 18,

561
01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.890
Monal S: We will let them in our system.

562
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:42.019
Monal S: Are we clear? Are we able to understand?

563
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.190
Monal S: Everyone, are we able to… are we able to relate to the real world?

564
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:50.550
Monal S: Great.

565
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.239
Monal S: Tech, non-tech, I'm asking everyone.

566
01:01:56.090 --> 01:02:12.260
Monal S: Okay? So you, as a developer, have total control of your system, what you want to do, what variable you want to create, everything. Clear from non-tech, that's great, Praveen, alright? So, we have completed this. Now, the next part is, we will jump to the next

567
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.440
Monal S: operators, alright? The next one that we have is…

568
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:26.060
Monal S: assignment operator, alright? This one is a little tricky for at the start, Assignment Operator.

569
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.080
Monal S: All right.

570
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:34.200
Monal S: So these are the operators which is used to assign values. So if I write A is equal to 2, it means…

571
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:41.849
Monal S: We are assigning the value of 2 to a variable called as A. Are we clear? Are we clear how to read this?

572
01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:46.900
Monal S: Everyone clear how to read this?

573
01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.160
Monal S: Guys, tell me fast.

574
01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.740
Monal S: Guys, you are saying no?

575
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:55.129
Monal S: This is literally the second class.

576
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.780
Monal S: We are assigning the value of 2 to a variable called as A.

577
01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:01.889
Monal S: We did this on day one.

578
01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.210
Monal S: Next kind of assignment operator.

579
01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.320
Monal S: Plus equals to 2.

580
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:20.689
Monal S: plus equals to 2, or let's say plus equals to 1. Let's see how to read it. Everyone, very important, everything is going to be the same. Alright? Everything is going to be the same.

581
01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.040
Monal S: Assignment.

582
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:26.590
Monal S: Assignment Operator.

583
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.100
Monal S: Yes, guys. No, no, no, that is not same.

584
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:35.200
Monal S: Say this, we have seen A is equal to 2. It means

585
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:46.620
Monal S: It means we are assigning the value of 2 to A. When I write A plus equals to 2, guys, there is a difference. I am not writing A plus 2 is equals to something.

586
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.110
Monal S: Are we able to understand? See this?

587
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:58.490
Monal S: If you expand this to Python, see this, how to read it. This means A is equals to A plus 2.

588
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.830
Monal S: Everyone, please…

589
01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:12.499
Monal S: understand, try to understand this, very simple. Plus equals is together. When we unroll it to the Pythonic way, this means

590
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:16.670
Monal S: A is equals to A plus 2.

591
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:28.219
Monal S: So, it assumes that A's already have some value, Are we clear?

592
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:34.409
Monal S: So we will first initialize the value of A, then we will do this operation.

593
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:37.139
Monal S: Are we clear?

594
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.349
Monal S: Are we clear?

595
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:54.030
Monal S: So, in order to… because if I don't write… if I don't write A equals to 2, then write this, what will happen? Python will first see this code, top to bottom, right to left.

596
01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:03.949
Monal S: This is operation right, operation left. It will go from here to here. Then it will start solving the right side. In right side, we will see A.

597
01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:16.770
Monal S: If A does not have any value, Python will say, where is A? I don't know A. Are you able to understand, guys? Top to bottom, right to left, then within operation, we go from left to right.

598
01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.960
Monal S: A, let's do.

599
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.520
Monal S: Yes?

600
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.380
Monal S: It does not know it.

601
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:35.650
Monal S: So, it needs a value. Similarly, we have A minus equals to 2. It means…

602
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.489
Monal S: A is equals to A minus 2.

603
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:47.290
Monal S: We have A divided by equals to 2. It means A is equals to A divided by 2.

604
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:56.210
Monal S: We have A, asterisk means multiplication is equals to 2. This means A is equals to A multiplied by 2.

605
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:00.840
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand this?

606
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:06.119
Monal S: Just the way we write, but how we read it is what we are learning.

607
01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:11.780
Monal S: You can also co-write the code, it is totally fine. Guys.

608
01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.760
Monal S: The only advantage it gives you is…

609
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:21.579
Monal S: You don't have to write this long code, you can do this with one less letter.

610
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:31.279
Monal S: Both of them does the same job, it's totally up to you whether you want to use this or use this. Both of them are equal.

611
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.810
Monal S: Both of them are equal. Here we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

612
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.099
Monal S: Five words.

613
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.650
Monal S: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4th.

614
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:45.569
Monal S: If this confuses you, then use this. If you like this, use this.

615
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.060
Monal S: Guys, how to read this?

616
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:50.910
Monal S: I literally told you how to convert it.

617
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:55.840
Monal S: A multiplication is equals to 2 is same as…

618
01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:00.210
Monal S: This is how we read it. A is equal to A multiplied by 2.

619
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:07.200
Monal S: So, the operation we perform should be the first

620
01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.830
Monal S: Character here in the operation set.

621
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:13.080
Monal S: Second is assignment.

622
01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.099
Monal S: You cannot switch it.

623
01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:24.730
Monal S: What does this mean? If I write A is equal to minus 2, it means A is equals to…

624
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.670
Monal S: What's… how should I write it?

625
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:42.919
Monal S: Okay, this is not how it works. So, everyone, all the things, you can see, all of them are following a standard. Standard means what operation you want to perform? Addition. What do you want to do after that? Assignment.

626
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.560
Monal S: Is this part clear?

627
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.900
Monal S: Alright, see this. Now let's code.

628
01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:07.319
Monal S: So what should be the value? If A was 2 originally, what should be the value here? What should be the value of A? Let me unroll it. A is equals to A plus 1.

629
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:14.520
Monal S: What should be the new value of A, everyone? If A was 2 before, what should be the new value of A?

630
01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:23.999
Monal S: A was 2, plus 1 will give you 3. 3 will be in present in A. So this operation will give you update in the A itself.

631
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:27.680
Monal S: Is this clear?

632
01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.700
Monal S: Is this clear?

633
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.669
Monal S: Similarly, if I do minus equals to what will happen.

634
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:36.129
Monal S: What should be the new value of A?

635
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.299
Monal S: What should be the new value of A?

636
01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:47.569
Monal S: Guys, we are updating the value, that's why it is A equals to A minus 1. It should be 2.

637
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:52.250
Monal S: Guys, we are just doing subtraction of minus 1 from the original A.

638
01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:56.130
Monal S: It was 3 before, see, it changed the value.

639
01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.079
Monal S: A is equals to A plus 1, we are changing the value, yes or no?

640
01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:09.129
Monal S: When we were changing the value, now A has become 3. It is not… it was 2 here. It became 3 here, it became 2 here.

641
01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.800
Monal S: This is where we are initializing the value.

642
01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:14.910
Monal S: Sitaram?

643
01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:21.630
Monal S: We are initializing here.

644
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:28.520
Monal S: Now…

645
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:33.919
Monal S: What should be the value of A?

646
01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:41.810
Monal S: Tell me what should be the value of A. It is 2 here. If I multiply it by 2, I should get 4.

647
01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.510
Monal S: I'm getting 4? Yes.

648
01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:48.370
Monal S: If I do this, what should be the value?

649
01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:51.800
Monal S: 2 again.

650
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:55.050
Monal S: But it is getting flowed because we are using single.

651
01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:59.839
Monal S: Now, if I show you this, What should be the value?

652
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.040
Monal S: Guys, why will you get 0? 2 divided by 2 will give you 1,

653
01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:13.610
Monal S: Okay?

654
01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:22.280
Monal S: Guys, for DSA, I will tell you some good news, but floor division.

655
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.490
Monal S: Yes. Sir, one question, why the operator plus, minus, and asterisk you used before,

656
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:35.329
Monal S: use before equal. Can we use after equal? Guys, this is how the way. Now, this is a question like this.

657
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.710
Monal S: Sir, can you write your name like this?

658
01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:46.350
Monal S: I can write it, but does it make sense?

659
01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.009
Monal S: My name is this, this is the way I write my name.

660
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.880
Monal S: This is the way we write these operators.

661
01:10:53.260 --> 01:11:09.699
Monal S: There is no other way. This is what developers who created this language created the standard way. If it is not standard, Python will be confused. You're telling Python, use this, use this, I mean both of them to be same. Now, Python will get confused.

662
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:18.210
Monal S: Are we able to understand? So, whenever we are doing coding, we always want to maintain a standard across.

663
01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.829
Monal S: Is everyone clear? Always the standard.

664
01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.800
Monal S: For people who came from

665
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:40.120
Monal S: Different one. In Python, we don't have A++. This is what we use in C++, C, but we don't have in Python. That is not an operator.

666
01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:42.980
Monal S: Java also.

667
01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:46.290
Monal S: Everyone clear with the relational operators?

668
01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:51.700
Monal S: Everyone claim with the relational operators. Very simple, guys, very simple.

669
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.619
Monal S: What is the next operator that we have? Okay, assignment, sorry, we did assignment.

670
01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:01.519
Monal S: Guys, how many of you don't know this?

671
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:07.739
Monal S: How many of you don't know this slash and double slash?

672
01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:12.309
Monal S: It means, from the day one, you guys are not revising.

673
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.140
Monal S: It means from the day one, you guys are not revising.

674
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:27.770
Monal S: Right?

675
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:29.900
Monal S: Alright.

676
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:37.490
Monal S: Assignment is done, logical. Alright? Assignment is done, logical is next, logical is little advanced.

677
01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:40.159
Monal S: And, just give me a second.

678
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:42.090
Monal S: Just give me a second, alright?

679
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:31.869
Monal S: Yes, I am back. Alright?

680
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:43.119
Monal S: Sir, if you're using slash output view 1, it is the way it is printing for you, alright? But this is how it should work. If I show you here, if you divide A, which is here.

681
01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.939
Monal S: by… Let's say 0.3.

682
01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.779
Monal S: We still get without precision, yes?

683
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:53.590
Monal S: Priya?

684
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.420
Monal S: Are we getting any point?

685
01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.450
Monal S: No.

686
01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:02.029
Monal S: It shows you, like, a flow, but it does not retain the precision value.

687
01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:07.719
Monal S: It is not working for you, Surya, Python will work the same for each and every one of you.

688
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:11.250
Monal S: Alright?

689
01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.729
Monal S: Okay, logical operator.

690
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:28.360
Monal S: Type error cannot concatenate, it means you are doing something weird. Surya, I will show… check your code. You are doing something weird, for sure. Tell me… show me your code, copy and paste your code here.

691
01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:31.940
Monal S: logical operator.

692
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.430
Monal S: Guys, do I need to repeat this?

693
01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:44.910
Monal S: I told you this in the class!

694
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:57.440
Monal S: This is division, actual division. This is division, and it does the floor. It is floor division. It will not have the precision.

695
01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.000
Monal S: This one will have the precision.

696
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.889
Monal S: This double will not have the precision, but only the point before the decimal.

697
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:11.589
Monal S: Guys… If you don't do your homework, what can I do for you?

698
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:17.339
Monal S: 0.3 gives 3. A divided by 0.3 gives D. What is the value of A?

699
01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:23.809
Monal S: Man… If A is 3, and I divide by 0.3,

700
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:28.239
Monal S: What is the value which we are getting? Sorry, this is A.

701
01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:33.770
Monal S: I have changed the value of A. Whatever the value of A is, now if I run it, it will not get. We are getting 10.

702
01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.630
Monal S: If you're getting 10,

703
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:43.359
Monal S: It means it was 30 before. I changed the value. But it is the same thing, guys, it is the same thing. Now you have changed the notes which I've created.

704
01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.619
Monal S: Okay, let me run it again.

705
01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:50.249
Monal S: And you will understand. It was 6.66

706
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:53.170
Monal S: But when I do double slash, it is now 6.

707
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:55.920
Monal S: Alright.

708
01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:09.499
Monal S: Everything will work, guys. You are doing something weird. I trust Python more than everyone's queries, so I know it will work. You are doing something weird, I will help you later. Next is logical.

709
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:14.000
Monal S: logical operators.

710
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:22.200
Monal S: Okay, how many of you remember Logic Table? At least, how many of you have heard about truth table?

711
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:29.699
Monal S: Truth table. How many of you have heard? Non-tech people, I'm asking? How many of you have heard truth table?

712
01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:35.730
Monal S: Not heard, not heard, great. It's fine. Okay?

713
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:37.270
Monal S: So…

714
01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:48.330
Monal S: This is something which you guys need to kind of remember, alright? If you don't know, you can revise it in your free time, but this is… this will set the base of

715
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:55.189
Monal S: Okay. In electronics, in electronics, we have something called as logic gates.

716
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:58.030
Monal S: Just giving you a little bit of,

717
01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:04.689
Monal S: background on this, okay? In electronics, we have something called as logic gate.

718
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:19.630
Monal S: Because I told you that electricity on is 1, electricity off is 0, if we only have electricity on or off, just like a switch in our homes, just like a switch in our homes, we can only do on and off.

719
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:30.279
Monal S: But our computers, which also works on electricity, does not just have on and off. They use this more complex way to provide you answer.

720
01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:41.020
Monal S: And there comes logic gates, okay? Logic gate is a way to control your electricity in such a way that you can create more logic.

721
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:52.939
Monal S: Alright, you can create more logic. Logic means, if I have one, I want 0. What is the logic behind this? Everyone tell me, if the input is 1, I want 0. What is the logic?

722
01:17:53.480 --> 01:18:03.010
Monal S: What is the logic? In Python, we have just seen naught, Nord means… Oppose it, Yes?

723
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:21.220
Monal S: What do we call this? This is… we will call it as a logic. Similarly, NOT is one of the logic. We have multiples of this logic to control the electricity in a way. The more we are able to control, it means the more we have flexibility to control our hardware just from Python itself.

724
01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:28.560
Monal S: So what we will do, we will have truth table, which tells us the behavior of on and off.

725
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.739
Monal S: and the final output. What we should do with this on and off, alright? You will understand now.

726
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:39.469
Monal S: So, the first truth table, which we'll be learning is called as ANDGATE.

727
01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:43.260
Monal S: Okay, and git. So let me first draw these things.

728
01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:44.990
Monal S: Peter…

729
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:17.830
Monal S: This is better. Alright.

730
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:19.550
Monal S: Yes.

731
01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:27.210
Monal S: So, first of all, I'm asking, if I have two values, A, and B.

732
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:30.129
Monal S: A and B.

733
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.559
Monal S: A can have two values.

734
01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:42.070
Monal S: B can have two values. Tell me all the possible combinations of 2, all the possible combinations of two. How many combinations we can create?

735
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:51.610
Monal S: Maximum number we can have in a combination, just like 00 is a combination. It has two total lengths. How many total possible combinations we can create?

736
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:53.350
Monal S: Everyone!

737
01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.659
Monal S: One combination is 0, 0.

738
01:19:56.910 --> 01:20:05.189
Monal S: Another combination is 1-1. Another combination is 0, 1, another combination is 1-0. Can we create more than this?

739
01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:08.160
Monal S: Can we create more than this?

740
01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:09.780
Monal S: No.

741
01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:28.099
Monal S: So now that we have all the possible combination, now we will talk about the operator. Which operator we are currently learning. The first operator we are learning is AND, okay? Now I will talk about how do we read AND operator. How do we read AND operator?

742
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:35.770
Monal S: So, AND means… Produces true when…

743
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.109
Monal S: Produces true when both are true.

744
01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.659
Monal S: Guys, true in Python also means…

745
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:46.720
Monal S: True in Python also means 1.

746
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:58.060
Monal S: Answer, it gives you true when both are true, else it is… the answer is false.

747
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.059
Monal S: False means zero.

748
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.880
Monal S: Pulse is 0. Now read this.

749
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:08.470
Monal S: Bell, are both of them true?

750
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:10.589
Monal S: Are both of them true?

751
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:24.969
Monal S: Both of them are true? No. What should be the answer? What should be the answer?

752
01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:31.969
Monal S: False. Guys, if both of them are not true, and says it is false. Zero.

753
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.970
Monal S: Are both of them true?

754
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:42.890
Monal S: Are both of them true? Yes. Are both of them true? No. Are both of them true? No. Only one of them is true here.

755
01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:51.169
Monal S: Only one of them is true. This is what AND says. AND says only when both of them are same.

756
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:52.990
Monal S: Then it is true.

757
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:54.930
Monal S: Are you clear?

758
01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.080
Monal S: Pulkit is saying wrong. Pulkit, what is wrong? Tell me.

759
01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:04.940
Monal S: Enlighten me, Pulkit.

760
01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.419
Monal S: Polkit is saying this is R.

761
01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:16.379
Monal S: Bool kit.

762
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.019
Monal S: How confident you are, ma'am?

763
01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.699
Monal S: Polkit, I will show you.

764
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:48.360
Monal S: Bulgate?

765
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:50.940
Monal S: This is from Real Digit.

766
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.490
Monal S: Pullkit?

767
01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.649
Monal S: Are you clear, Polkad?

768
01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:05.829
Monal S: Now you're not repeating 3 times? Wrong, wrong, wrong.

769
01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.060
Monal S: See?

770
01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:10.390
Monal S: It's fine.

771
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.050
Monal S: Right?

772
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:16.800
Monal S: So, guys, and this is the main definition of AND. It's fine pool kit, okay?

773
01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:21.710
Monal S: But sometimes what happens is that people act different, but you are not acting, so that is good.

774
01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:24.660
Monal S: Next!

775
01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:26.549
Monal S: Everyone, next.

776
01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:28.200
Monal S: R.

777
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:31.190
Monal S: I'm talking about OR.

778
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:39.040
Monal S: Guys, I will talk about why I'm talking about Gates. I can ignore this gates concept, but…

779
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:49.620
Monal S: you will not understand when we are going to use the Python gates. Python gates is a little different. OR. What OR tells you… everyone see the definition of OR.

780
01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.250
Monal S: Okay?

781
01:23:52.030 --> 01:24:01.779
Monal S: R is… If… If any… if anyone… is true.

782
01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.770
Monal S: If anyone is true, The answer is true.

783
01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.040
Monal S: Just wait, guys, okay?

784
01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.840
Monal S: If anyone is true, answer is true.

785
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:27.880
Monal S: Else?

786
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.180
Monal S: As?

787
01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.960
Monal S: False.

788
01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.980
Monal S: Let's fill it. If any one of them is true, let's fill now.

789
01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:42.780
Monal S: If any one of them is true, no. None of them have won. Answer is 0.

790
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.170
Monal S: Any of them have won? Yes.

791
01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:49.999
Monal S: Any of them have won? Yes. Any of them have won? Yes.

792
01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:52.680
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

793
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:56.550
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

794
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:58.350
Monal S: Alright.

795
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:05.570
Monal S: Now, there is next operator. Once we… I cover the operator, Python operators is just, like, 2 minutes of work.

796
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:07.050
Monal S: Toter.

797
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:13.249
Monal S: Next one that we are covering is called as NOT. Everyone already know NOT?

798
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:20.140
Monal S: But NOT does not work with 2. NOT only works with… one variable.

799
01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:25.330
Monal S: The work of not… and if you only have one variable, are you going to have four combinations?

800
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:33.010
Monal S: If we have one variable, are we going to have four combinations? No, only 0 and 1 possibilities there, so I will remove this.

801
01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.300
Monal S: What not tells you?

802
01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:38.169
Monal S: What not tells you?

803
01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:44.329
Monal S: Nought is, if the answer is true, Provide the opposite.

804
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:48.020
Monal S: If the answer is false, provide the opposite.

805
01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.679
Monal S: Let's fill the naught, 0 will 1, 1 will be 0.

806
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.599
Monal S: Are we clear? Very simple.

807
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.590
Monal S: So we have covered what we'll be using in Python a lot.

808
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:02.459
Monal S: AND, OR, and NOT.

809
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:19.570
Monal S: Clear. So now, let me show you what is… please, okay, you guys want Zorb? Okay. Guys, there is one operator which is very popular, but in Python, I have never personally used Zorb, okay? But just for…

810
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:30.620
Monal S: you guys understanding, I will select ZOT. I don't want to write a lot of things, so I will copy the OR, which is all four combinations.

811
01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:32.260
Monal S: Paste it here.

812
01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:35.070
Monal S: And let's learn Zorp.

813
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:39.830
Monal S: So guys, in Zor, ZOR, we already seen that it is OR.

814
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:46.330
Monal S: Yes, you can already see it as all. Now, let me write what is the meaning of this.

815
01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:53.930
Monal S: ZOR is another operator, which is… Only true.

816
01:26:55.830 --> 01:27:04.530
Monal S: only true… Then… One of them… is true.

817
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:08.420
Monal S: Only when one of them is true.

818
01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:14.919
Monal S: It is not saying both of them. Anshul, can you please let me teach this Zorb?

819
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:16.909
Monal S: If possible, Anshu.

820
01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:18.920
Monal S: Then I will repeat N.

821
01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.300
Monal S: Can I please request that from you?

822
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:27.130
Monal S: Guys.

823
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:35.949
Monal S: In or, if any of them is true, the answer is true. It is any one of them. Here, when only

824
01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:37.720
Monal S: One of them is true.

825
01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.100
Monal S: Only one of them is true.

826
01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:50.340
Monal S: In case of OR, if any of them has 1, the answer is 1. Here, if only if one of them is true. See this?

827
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.039
Monal S: See, this is very important, now you will understand.

828
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:58.199
Monal S: It has one small difference as compared to your org.

829
01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:01.080
Monal S: Tell me if any of them is one?

830
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:03.069
Monal S: Any of them is one? No.

831
01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.430
Monal S: Here, we have both of them as one.

832
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.760
Monal S: Here, we have both of them as one.

833
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:15.860
Monal S: Answer is 0. Here we have only one of them is 1.

834
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.979
Monal S: Only one of them is one.

835
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:27.859
Monal S: Ravi, this is what I've written, right?

836
01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:39.020
Monal S: Are we clear?

837
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:48.410
Monal S: It is ZOR or XOR.

838
01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:49.910
Monal S: Alright?

839
01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:59.589
Monal S: So guys, just for a small recap, and I'm not going to repeat this, and is, it is true when both of them are true.

840
01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.040
Monal S: It is true when both of them are true. Only both of them are true.

841
01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:06.799
Monal S: We will get this.

842
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.040
Monal S: Or is, when any of them is true.

843
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:12.839
Monal S: When any of them is true.

844
01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:22.740
Monal S: Yeah, Surya. You need to assign it, then it'll work.

845
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:25.470
Monal S: Any of them is true, it will work.

846
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:33.259
Monal S: NOT is opposite of what the value is, it only works with one variable, and ZOR is if

847
01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:41.729
Monal S: only one of them is true, it will work. Guys, I'm just giving you a way to learn it easily. You can check notebooks, you can check the actual,

848
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:47.650
Monal S: books to get the real definition, but I just want to make your work simple.

849
01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:54.670
Monal S: Not is a bit confusing, what is not? 0 is 1, 0 is 1, 1 is 0, that's all.

850
01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:56.830
Monal S: So now, let's do the practical.

851
01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:02.799
Monal S: Everyone, now let's do the practical, and in Python, it is very, very, very simple.

852
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.430
Monal S: How many of you think that it is simple?

853
01:30:07.730 --> 01:30:11.550
Monal S: Guys… How many of you think that this is simple?

854
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:32.989
Monal S: So, this works with true and false. So, let me write, here, let's say, bool A. It means it is a variable called as A, but it is a type bool.

855
01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:34.300
Monal S: It is true.

856
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:37.529
Monal S: And here we have rule of B.

857
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:41.689
Monal S: Here we have bool of B. I will say it as false.

858
01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:50.230
Monal S: Alright? True and false. So, I have two variables. Now, what we will do… Bull A, and…

859
01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:57.479
Monal S: Boole B. Duvino and Does everyone here knows, and…

860
01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:02.260
Monal S: It means 1 and 0. What is 1 and 0?

861
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:10.210
Monal S: What is 1 or 0?

862
01:31:11.690 --> 01:31:13.269
Monal S: What is 1 or 0?

863
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:23.109
Monal S: What is… What is NOT 0?

864
01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:28.840
Monal S: Bull B is 0, right? Bull B is false. What is NOT 0? Naught 0 is 1.

865
01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.169
Monal S: What is not one?

866
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:39.650
Monal S: Is everyone clear? Now I will tell you how to read all of this.

867
01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:47.389
Monal S: Alright? How to read all of this, okay? Now let's create a statement, and then we will write the code for it.

868
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:51.750
Monal S: Here, I'm saying that… If a person… okay.

869
01:31:55.190 --> 01:32:00.560
Monal S: Club… Entry conditions.

870
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:04.150
Monal S: Okay? Club entry conditions.

871
01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:06.459
Monal S: First condition, we will write it as…

872
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:12.610
Monal S: Person should be over 18.

873
01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:22.700
Monal S: Second is… person… should have… at least…

874
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:36.040
Monal S: 500 in your local currency, alright? 500, I'm going to write INR. INR is Indian currency, alright? Person should have at least 500 INR to enter in club.

875
01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:43.689
Monal S: Is this fine? So, here we have two conditions. It means both of them should be true. Are we clear?

876
01:32:44.210 --> 01:32:48.409
Monal S: Both of them should be true. Only then we will let them enter.

877
01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:52.640
Monal S: Only then we will let them enter. Tell me what we should use here.

878
01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.270
Monal S: Tell me what we should use here.

879
01:32:55.730 --> 01:33:01.630
Monal S: There is only one operator which tells you when both of them is true, we will let them enter.

880
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:06.270
Monal S: So, here I will write… Person Age.

881
01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:15.540
Monal S: Alright, here I will write person age, Person age is, let's suppose, 20.

882
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.189
Monal S: But what is the person threshold?

883
01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:23.240
Monal S: What is the person threshold which we have defined? Tell me… 18.

884
01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:30.449
Monal S: Now let's talk about… Minimum… Balance they should have.

885
01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:36.700
Monal S: We have defined 500. This is… Person Balance.

886
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.920
Monal S: Let's suppose it is Henrid.

887
01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:45.870
Monal S: Just giving an example. So this is, now that we have 4 values, now, see, this is how we should write.

888
01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:49.299
Monal S: I will write, First is…

889
01:33:54.540 --> 01:34:01.729
Monal S: Person thread… person age… Should be greater than or equals to person threshold.

890
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:05.440
Monal S: Does it satisfies this one, everyone?

891
01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:08.630
Monal S: Is this line satisfying the first condition?

892
01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:26.080
Monal S: So, let's close with bracket. Bracket, when Python sees, it will solve everything in the bracket, and it will replace by value, alright? It is not something magical. We are just enclosing inside bracket, just like we do in our calculator.

893
01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:28.620
Monal S: Alright, what is the next one?

894
01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.850
Monal S: What is the next one we should use?

895
01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:40.779
Monal S: If person balance is greater than or equal to minimum balance, then this satisfies the second condition.

896
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:41.850
Monal S: Guess?

897
01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.339
Monal S: What we want between these two?

898
01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.460
Monal S: What we want between these two?

899
01:34:48.880 --> 01:35:00.380
Monal S: We want to check both of them to be true, so can I write AND and this condition? This will give you an answer in true and false. This will give you answer in true and false.

900
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:05.949
Monal S: True and false, true and false will give you AND operation. Yes?

901
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:15.739
Monal S: If I do print, I've enclosed this whole inner thing inside a print.

902
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:21.230
Monal S: So this all will be replaced by the final true or false. We will just print it, so let's see.

903
01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.140
Monal S: False. Why?

904
01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:32.179
Monal S: Because we can see person age is 20, but person balance is 100. If I make it 600, will it make both the condition as true?

905
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:37.009
Monal S: Person age is already correct. Now, person balance is also correct. Let's see.

906
01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.229
Monal S: Is it working? Is everyone able to create the logic?

907
01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.020
Monal S: Are we able to understand logical operators? Very simple.

908
01:35:52.990 --> 01:36:08.370
Monal S: As I'm an electrical engineer, it is more, understandable to me. That's great, guys. That's great. Very simple. So, guys, see, in day one, we started storing things. Now, we are storing things, but creating our own logic, that is what developers is.

909
01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:24.589
Monal S: We create our own logic. So this is how you should think. Everything is at the end storage, but what you will do with the storage, create logic from it using Python languages, this is operator, this is another operator, and create the final thing.

910
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:28.520
Monal S: Simple. Everyone is enjoying today's class.

911
01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:33.409
Monal S: Guys, are you enjoying today's class? Is it hard?

912
01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.140
Monal S: Is it hard?

913
01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:36.230
Monal S: No.

914
01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.090
Monal S: Alright?

915
01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.619
Monal S: And everyone, do you like the way we are writing these folder structures?

916
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:58.210
Monal S: Easy to maintain. See, in the initial classes, you might feel it… feel like it is a lot of work, we need to maintain this. But as you move forward, if you create this structure, it is very organized.

917
01:36:58.510 --> 01:37:03.170
Monal S: In the initial phases, it might feel chaotic, but it is very organized.

918
01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:11.180
Monal S: So, if I'm teaching something, it feels complex, trust me, it is for your own good.

919
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:18.729
Monal S: Alright? So guys, it is already 10.32, just give me a second, alright? I just need to make a one call. If…

920
01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:22.619
Monal S: Mentor is available, I will check one thing. Just need to check one thing.

921
01:37:23.130 --> 01:37:31.399
Monal S: Guys, ZOR is directly not available in Python, but I was just teaching ZOR because people want it. We don't need ZOR here, in our case.

922
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:35.579
Monal S: All right? Thank you very much, guys, thank you.

923
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:19.210
Monal S: Alright, the one which I was talking about. Guys, your screen is not frozen, I was not doing anything, alright? I was just checking with someone, but maybe we will do that later.

924
01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:31.949
Monal S: Okay, so it is 10.33 here, good time to give break, but 15 minutes is more than enough, right? So after break, what is our goal? Let's, again, go back to where we were.

925
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:35.360
Monal S: We have… we are done with operators.

926
01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:39.329
Monal S: Alright, we are done with operators, now we will go to…

927
01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:41.969
Monal S: But now we will go to Control Flow.

928
01:38:44.230 --> 01:38:47.890
Monal S: Control flow is also a very simple, but very powerful part.

929
01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:49.170
Monal S: Alright?

930
01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:55.029
Monal S: And, do you guys want to know? Guys, Bitwise, I never use.

931
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.200
Monal S: If you want to learn bitwise, I will tell you bitwise.

932
01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:00.450
Monal S: How many of you want to learn bitwise?

933
01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.420
Monal S: Alright? So, after Bitwise, can I give break?

934
01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.749
Monal S: After Bitwise, it will not take long.

935
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:14.090
Monal S: Very simple.

936
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:25.139
Monal S: Say this, I'm not going to bitwise because it, again, I need to tell the fundamentals, alright? But, yeah, let me tell the fundamentals. Where is it? Everyone say this.

937
01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:33.600
Monal S: I'm okay to skip few things, but if it is not useful… I've never used Bitwise, right?

938
01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:39.669
Monal S: There are use cases, but again, in competitive programming and other places.

939
01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:42.890
Monal S: Okay? So I will tell you,

940
01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:53.060
Monal S: When we work with bit, I told you that computers don't understand 1, 2, 3, 4. Our CPU does not understand 1, 2, 3, 4. Our CPU understands

941
01:39:53.430 --> 01:40:09.510
Monal S: Our CPU understand what language, binary language, numbers are language which consists of only 0 and 1, alright? And anything can be written in 0 and 1, and there is a way to do it. This is how we should do. 1, 2, 4.

942
01:40:10.090 --> 01:40:15.289
Monal S: 1, 2, 4. Tell me, if I add this number, what is the total we will get?

943
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:19.210
Monal S: If I add this number, what is the total we will get?

944
01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:39.539
Monal S: This works like 2 to the power of 0, 2 to the power of 1, 2 to the power of 2, 2 to the power of 3, whatever the number is, we write it here, alright? But I'm only going to write here, just for making you understand, 2 to the power of 2, which is 4.

945
01:40:39.690 --> 01:40:51.450
Monal S: The final output, the total which we can get is 7. So it means we can write 1 to 7 using 4 to 1 as the stage. Suppose this is our stage.

946
01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.359
Monal S: Now, let's write one. Let's write one.

947
01:40:54.660 --> 01:41:01.840
Monal S: It should only consist of 0 and 1. So if I need to write 1, which combinations I should use to write 1?

948
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:05.210
Monal S: The first one. Other should be 0.

949
01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:17.819
Monal S: So, 1, when we have a three-stage binary, will be 001. So, 001 is called as 1. If I talk about 2, which combinations I can use to write 2?

950
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.739
Monal S: The middle one, 010, because this is 2. Let's talk about 3.

951
01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:29.539
Monal S: which combinations I should use, which will make the total sum as 3.

952
01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.120
Monal S: Total sum is 3.

953
01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:37.039
Monal S: If I make this, this is 4. If I make this, this is 2. I still need 1 more 1.

954
01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:41.729
Monal S: So, 2 plus 1, that is this one, will make it 3.

955
01:41:43.290 --> 01:41:49.180
Monal S: This is by 3 in binary. If I talk about 4, 4 is this one.

956
01:41:49.290 --> 01:41:52.790
Monal S: If I talk about the last number, 7, 7 means…

957
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:56.149
Monal S: 4 plus 2 plus 1. This will give you 7.

958
01:41:56.510 --> 01:42:05.080
Monal S: Are we able to create 1 to 7? Will we be able to create whole 1 to 7 using this system? Yes? Alright.

959
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:09.960
Monal S: So, bitwise operators in Python, we have something like as AND

960
01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:15.949
Monal S: OR and NOT. Similarly, which we did, but this is the symbol which we will be using.

961
01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:23.490
Monal S: It is the same like a logical operator, but instead of working with numbers, We work with binary.

962
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:28.919
Monal S: We work with binary. And now, let's see it. Everyone knows AND or NOT?

963
01:42:29.150 --> 01:42:31.149
Monal S: Everyone knows AND or NOT.

964
01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:37.749
Monal S: Yes, now we will see. Let's suppose I want to work with a number of 3.

965
01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.839
Monal S: Just wait, okay? Again, just wait.

966
01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:11.519
Monal S: Okay, so you guys will get surprised. So, let's do for 3 and 1. Where is 3? This is 3. We are selecting 3 and 1 for operation.

967
01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:16.300
Monal S: So we will select this, we will select this. So let me write first 3.

968
01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.889
Monal S: Where is our 3?

969
01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:23.960
Monal S: 011. This is our 3. Now, I want to do… 1.

970
01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:27.140
Monal S: 1 is 0, 0, 1.

971
01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:34.390
Monal S: If I perform AND operation, AND means when both of them is 1, it will return 1.

972
01:43:34.810 --> 01:43:36.510
Monal S: Is both of them one?

973
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:42.430
Monal S: Answer is 0. Is both of them 1? Answer is 0. What is the final answer we are getting?

974
01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:45.299
Monal S: What this value is?

975
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:55.470
Monal S: 001 is 1. So when we do binary 3 and binary 1, when we perform AND operation, we get 1 as the answer.

976
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:57.640
Monal S: Are we clear?

977
01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.500
Monal S: So, it is on bitwise level. Are we clear, everyone?

978
01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:10.560
Monal S: Similarly, 011 and 001. Let's perform OR operation. This one is OR.

979
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:14.960
Monal S: OR means, if any of them has 1, answer is 1.

980
01:44:15.670 --> 01:44:16.610
Monal S: Yes?

981
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:27.730
Monal S: So, this will be 011. 011 is… 011 is 3.

982
01:44:27.930 --> 01:44:36.309
Monal S: So, 3 or 1 will gives you… see, I'm writing, 3, 1, performing the operation of OR will give you 3.

983
01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.630
Monal S: NOT. NOT works on opposite.

984
01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.929
Monal S: NOT again will work on only one number. If I do NOT of 3,

985
01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.950
Monal S: If I do NOT of the… this is how we write NOT.

986
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:48.709
Monal S: Naught of 3 will be?

987
01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:53.650
Monal S: 0 will give you 1, 1 will give you 0, 1 will give you 0.

988
01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.519
Monal S: What is the answer?

989
01:44:58.150 --> 01:44:58.980
Monal S: Fourth.

990
01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:02.339
Monal S: Naught of 3 gave you 4.

991
01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.209
Monal S: Are we clear, everyone?

992
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:11.789
Monal S: Alright? So, if you want to see this, I will show you.

993
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:21.709
Monal S: In Python, we don't have to write binary, but we can write something like if a… okay, let me write logic,

994
01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:29.160
Monal S: No. Carrot here is not.

995
01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.170
Monal S: Alright?

996
01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:36.649
Monal S: what exactly we are doing? We are doing bitwise operator. Sometimes even I get confused with the topics.

997
01:45:36.850 --> 01:45:38.580
Monal S: bitwise operators.

998
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:48.829
Monal S: We will again work with 3 and 1, so that we know exactly what is the answer. B is equals to 1, alright? So let's do print

999
01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:53.850
Monal S: print A, single and, and B.

1000
01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:57.380
Monal S: Same thing.

1001
01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.959
Monal S: Were we able to do the same thing, yes or no?

1002
01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:05.509
Monal S: Guys, yes or no?

1003
01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:12.390
Monal S: Guys, I'm only teaching you fundamentals because we don't have to waste time here, alright?

1004
01:46:13.210 --> 01:46:16.529
Monal S: This is… or… Same thing.

1005
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:20.500
Monal S: Working, Now, this one, I need to do what?

1006
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:24.449
Monal S: Okay, wait, wait.

1007
01:46:24.630 --> 01:46:36.470
Monal S: I gave you OR and AND, but this one is not, sorry. The symbol I messed up. Someone was wrong. The symbol of this one is tilde.

1008
01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.030
Monal S: Alright?

1009
01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:41.379
Monal S: Distilled data that we see is not.

1010
01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:45.750
Monal S: Alright? This one is Zor. Let me write it correctly.

1011
01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:48.780
Monal S: Are we clear now?

1012
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:50.969
Monal S: This one is not.

1013
01:46:51.610 --> 01:46:57.520
Monal S: So, if you have to write NOT, Notice, Thus, let me write it.

1014
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:03.200
Monal S: Yep.

1015
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:04.930
Monal S: It goes before.

1016
01:47:05.530 --> 01:47:06.530
Monal S: See this?

1017
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:16.040
Monal S: It gives you… why it is giving us… Negative here.

1018
01:47:17.690 --> 01:47:19.220
Monal S: Just give me a second, okay?

1019
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.720
Monal S: It gives you the complement.

1020
01:47:40.330 --> 01:47:43.530
Monal S: But I'm just checking… that…

1021
01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:50.530
Monal S: No, guys, A was… 3.

1022
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:54.829
Monal S: No, no, no, this is not only. I'm just looking that…

1023
01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.219
Monal S: When maybe some sign changes happens when we do not.

1024
01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:15.840
Monal S: Inverting 00 results in that one.

1025
01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:26.059
Monal S: Wait, wait, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, it is 3.

1026
01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:43.159
Monal S: it becomes 1, so it is negative. Yes, guys, there is a sign bit also that happens, so sine is also converting. Because it was positive, the sign is also doing the positive, okay? So it inverts all the bits.

1027
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:46.999
Monal S: Because the sign also has a number. Are we clear?

1028
01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:51.200
Monal S: When we do this, the sign internally also has a bit.

1029
01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:55.159
Monal S: It also flips the sign, that's why we are getting negative.

1030
01:48:56.150 --> 01:49:01.420
Monal S: But we have seen 4, 4 was correct. Guys, 4 was correct.

1031
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:03.629
Monal S: But it also flips the sign.

1032
01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:10.650
Monal S: Alright?

1033
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:32.410
Monal S: So, for all of this, we have to go into the bit level and understand it. So, that's why I'm not teaching, because, see, I will teach you one… I will show… I don't have that example, but I have seen one very good example of this gates, these bitwise operators. Someone used it in competitive programming.

1034
01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:47.329
Monal S: they performed some bitwise operation of something to find some missing value, and they were able to do it. So it is used in some edge cases, but you, me, someone who is not using that, is never going to use this bitwise.

1035
01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:52.850
Monal S: Alright? It's never going to use this bitwise.

1036
01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:59.139
Monal S: Guys, for 3, we did the bitwise of 4. Because it is positive, it also flipped the number.

1037
01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:05.210
Monal S: Alright? It also flips the number, and then we get the negative.

1038
01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:06.400
Monal S: Okay?

1039
01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:20.920
Monal S: So, this one is done. Guys, ZOR you can also do, if I have to do each and everything.

1040
01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:23.070
Monal S: What do you guys have to do for Zorp?

1041
01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:28.509
Monal S: I'm not going to solve it manually, but you guys can solve it. Where is this? This is all.

1042
01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:36.449
Monal S: Okay? Everyone knows how to solve ZOR. Guys, this is something unnecessary which we are doing, but everyone knows how to solve ZOR.

1043
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:39.609
Monal S: How many of you here does not know how to solve XOR?

1044
01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:43.010
Monal S: Yes, Ashish, actually, it adds one.

1045
01:50:43.610 --> 01:50:49.650
Monal S: While converting for the decimal, To decimal value, it converts its add plus 1 also.

1046
01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.189
Monal S: But I'm not going into the depth.

1047
01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:56.650
Monal S: Got it? Otherwise, people will get confused.

1048
01:50:57.490 --> 01:50:59.610
Monal S: Alright? So, this is done.

1049
01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:05.220
Monal S: Now that the logical part is done, anyone has any question on this logic… bitwise operator?

1050
01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:06.480
Monal S: Anyone?

1051
01:51:07.770 --> 01:51:09.550
Monal S: Guys, Bitwise, anyone?

1052
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:19.549
Monal S: Yes, Pradeep, it inverts it at once to convert into the decimal, but again, it adds some more steps. I don't want people to get confused.

1053
01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:31.159
Monal S: Pradeep, yes, it inverts all the values, add one to convert into decimal, then it does the switching of negative, plus to negative, negative to plus.

1054
01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:48.750
Monal S: Can we print output in binary? Guys, there are functions which does it. Let me just show you. Decimal to binary in Python. I don't really use it, that's why I'm also looking at it, but I've seen it before, okay? So, yes, you have something called as bin.

1055
01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:59.690
Monal S: For a number, if A is equals to 30, if you want to convert that to a binary, you just pass to a function of bin, and pass the number. It gives you binary.

1056
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:02.240
Monal S: Binary of that number.

1057
01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:04.720
Monal S: Okay?

1058
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.479
Monal S: If you want to see that binary, we will see that slicing again.

1059
01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:20.939
Monal S: Guys, we don't… we rarely use it, and me, personally, I have never used it. So let's not waste time here, okay? Because it is a part of the syllabus I'm teaching you.

1060
01:52:21.130 --> 01:52:24.179
Monal S: So we are able to complete our whole operators.

1061
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.139
Monal S: Anura, right now, we are not at that stage.

1062
01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:38.560
Monal S: Guys, how many of you, as a child, when you were learning A, B, C, D, ask that what I'm going to do with that A, B, C, D?

1063
01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:47.420
Monal S: Currently, we are in AVCD of programming. We are understanding the power of program once we understand it. I told you.

1064
01:52:47.580 --> 01:53:05.489
Monal S: We learned ABCD, but we combined ABCD to create something bigger. Similarly, right now, we are using Bitwise and others, which is not at all useful in our data science job, alright? It is a part of Python. Whatever is part of useful, I will teach you examples, but this one is not at all required.

1065
01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:11.229
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand? You don't need to connect dots which you don't require.

1066
01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:14.640
Monal S: Yes, Sumit?

1067
01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:20.070
Monal S: Alright, so this one is done. Now let's go on break.

1068
01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:27.100
Monal S: Again, people are in bitwise shift. Guys, we can do anything. Why do you want to do it? Can't you?

1069
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:29.059
Monal S: Just… check it.

1070
01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:32.210
Monal S: So let me share the ti- let me…

1071
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:34.160
Monal S: Share the screen of the timer.

1072
01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.160
Monal S: And then let's move forward.

1073
01:53:40.290 --> 01:53:47.549
Monal S: Guys, you can skip bitwise, but I already taught you bitwise, so don't worry. So, I'm starting the timer, I will see you after break, okay?

1074
01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:49.510
Monal S: See you guys, bye-bye.

1075
02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:07.450
Mayank Aggarwal: Perfect.

1076
02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:10.490
Mayank Aggarwal: Hey, hi everyone. Very good morning.

1077
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:13.520
Mayank Aggarwal: Change of mentors in between.

1078
02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:17.750
Mayank Aggarwal: Administer.

1079
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:20.910
Mayank Aggarwal: I think the mic can be changed.

1080
02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:26.229
Mayank Aggarwal: Hi, hi everyone, Extreme Dish.

1081
02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:30.689
Mayank Aggarwal: Thankful request as epne kara. Sorry, extremely, I will do that.

1082
02:09:30.890 --> 02:09:34.879
Mayank Aggarwal: Or else you can send me your link off LinkedIn, I will do the same.

1083
02:09:35.330 --> 02:09:37.280
Mayank Aggarwal: Chica.

1084
02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:41.580
Mayank Aggarwal: Great, great, great. So I hope all of you are having fun while learning, right?

1085
02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:55.419
Mayank Aggarwal: All of you are having fun while learning. Have you been following your IDK series? Yes, thanks a lot for that. Rohit, I will be putting a pipe short for that, don't worry. So, no problem.

1086
02:09:56.190 --> 02:10:02.179
Mayank Aggarwal: Cool, everyone. So… Just a minute…

1087
02:10:23.010 --> 02:10:25.720
Mayank Aggarwal: Some funny thing, yeah, cool.

1088
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:28.980
Mayank Aggarwal: Great.

1089
02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:45.030
Mayank Aggarwal: So, yeah. Actually, everyone, I just wanted to share a few more things with all of you, as I promised. So, regarding the course. I will accept the request, everyone, don't worry. Extremely sorry, actually, as you all know, we are kind of working on some

1090
02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:56.310
Mayank Aggarwal: more things with respect to launch, right? So, yes, everyone now, this is actually one more course which we would like to provide you. Now, again, the course is hot and new, it is a bestseller, like, lots of people have taken it already.

1091
02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:57.870
Mayank Aggarwal: Good ratings.

1092
02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:58.750
Mayank Aggarwal: Okay?

1093
02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:02.240
Mayank Aggarwal: Again, I will tell you the idea, so…

1094
02:11:02.770 --> 02:11:14.789
Mayank Aggarwal: since you all are now learning from scratch, parallelly, it is not something which we can wait, right? So, the whole thing is that, everyone, we have to make sure that, parallelly, for people who are not aware.

1095
02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.620
Mayank Aggarwal: you are able to understand AI as well, right?

1096
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:29.979
Mayank Aggarwal: We don't want that, okay, one year after, when maybe things can change, you all are having no idea about AI. And again, I think that will happen in next 5-6 months only, because you are in this course.

1097
02:11:30.090 --> 02:11:38.379
Mayank Aggarwal: So, again, around this, around this agreement, what I'm providing you today is a course in which we have explained all about

1098
02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:57.390
Mayank Aggarwal: AI with NHN, so if you will see, AI Automation and Agentic AI Bootcamp. In this, actually, we have discussed about what is multi-agent architecture, MCP, RAG, and the best part is, again, nothing is with code, okay? So, yeah, I'm pasting the link in the chat, everyone. I hope all of you know how to use it.

1099
02:11:57.700 --> 02:11:59.319
Mayank Aggarwal: So, just pasting the link.

1100
02:11:59.510 --> 02:12:03.090
Mayank Aggarwal: I will shorten the link as well, so do make sure that you…

1101
02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:12.710
Mayank Aggarwal: take benefit of that. And yes, just like last time, it will be really helpful if you can go and provide a good rating for the course. So, if you all remember last time.

1102
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:23.940
Mayank Aggarwal: And I ask so that it reaches out to the maximum people. It's free, everyone, totally free, and there's a reason for this, giving this particular course. So, course coupon, okay, just let me share the link.

1103
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:28.749
Mayank Aggarwal: Just a minute, everyone, link shortener.

1104
02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:33.980
Mayank Aggarwal: So, just a minute, I will quickly share the links with all of you.

1105
02:12:34.110 --> 02:12:34.800
Mayank Aggarwal: Yeah.

1106
02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.410
Mayank Aggarwal: Okay.

1107
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:47.350
Mayank Aggarwal: So, yes, everyone, please go through the same. If you will see, again, please make sure that once you get access, how many people are able to get the access?

1108
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:54.920
Mayank Aggarwal: Okay, my bad.

1109
02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:01.230
Mayank Aggarwal: So, again, it will be totally free with the coupon I'm sharing.

1110
02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:05.009
Mayank Aggarwal: Apply the coupon, everyone. Let me check…

1111
02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:09.130
Mayank Aggarwal: Quickly, I think it should be free. Let me open it in Gognito.

1112
02:13:09.250 --> 02:13:12.350
Mayank Aggarwal: And then I will just take your… this much time.

1113
02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.120
Mayank Aggarwal: Okay.

1114
02:13:15.710 --> 02:13:18.339
Mayank Aggarwal: Okay, let me quickly check, everyone, extremely sorry.

1115
02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:20.169
Mayank Aggarwal: Why it is showing 399?

1116
02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:24.280
Mayank Aggarwal: Actually, I did ask you, Demi, to provide me with a coupon, but just one minute, okay?

1117
02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:28.620
Mayank Aggarwal: Don't pay, okay? I'll be providing you with the free coupon.

1118
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:40.650
Mayank Aggarwal: So, the reason between behind both these courses, everyone, is… Okay, yeah. So, pay attention, everyone, this is the one. Sorry, my bad. Yeah, I gave the wrong code.

1119
02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:41.770
Mayank Aggarwal: My bad.

1120
02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.659
Mayank Aggarwal: The one which I have given you, I think this is something which you can use.

1121
02:13:47.650 --> 02:13:53.060
Mayank Aggarwal: Okay? So, just go to this course and apply Learn AI instead, Learn AI.

1122
02:13:53.650 --> 02:13:56.560
Mayank Aggarwal: So, this is the Kubernet device they gave me.

1123
02:13:56.730 --> 02:14:07.950
Mayank Aggarwal: Okay? It will be then totally free, and as you can see, just one day is left at this price, everyone. And once you get the access, again, will be really helpful if you can go and just give a good rating. So, once you start learning.

1124
02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:16.740
Mayank Aggarwal: please go and leave a rating, and please make sure that it is 5-star. And also, please, please make sure that you take the benefit of this course, because as I told.

1125
02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:30.700
Mayank Aggarwal: We don't want that you are not aware about AI, and in this course specifically, we have explained about AI in depth. So the difference between this course and the last one which I shared is that this course helps you to understand about AI

1126
02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:42.949
Mayank Aggarwal: NATN and everything from scratch. Then, the next course, right, everyone? It can help you to start your agency with that. So, basically, starting and providing services with that. So, that's the whole plan, okay?

1127
02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:49.610
Mayank Aggarwal: Here's data engineering, which I am planning for that, don't worry, okay? So, Learn AI is the coupon, everyone. Go with this one first.

1128
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:53.869
Mayank Aggarwal: Go with this one first, and then the next one, okay? So this Learn AI is the coupon.

1129
02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:57.389
Mayank Aggarwal: Please make sure that you apply it. I think people will be able to do that.

1130
02:14:57.870 --> 02:14:58.680
Mayank Aggarwal: Right?

1131
02:14:59.310 --> 02:15:01.720
Mayank Aggarwal: It should be working, pretty sure it should be working.

1175
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.760
Monal S: Right, yes, thank you very much, Mangsar and guys.

1176
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:30.089
Monal S: If the rating is not visible to you right now, after you watch a few lectures, you will be able to see the rating. UDMA will automatically ask you to provide the rating, alright?

1177
02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:31.560
Monal S: And,

1178
02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:45.629
Monal S: We will be sharing… we can also share the link, yes. Guys, we can also share the link in the community later, okay? Whoever has access to that, they will be able to access it. So I've copied the link, and after the class is over, I will provide that link, all right?

1179
02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:47.320
Monal S: Alright?

1180
02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:51.150
Monal S: Everyone happy?

Monal S: Happy? Great. All right, awesome, guys. Don't worry, we'll tell you when to… which to pick one, what you should do with multiple courses and other things, alright?

1183
02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:15.199
Monal S: Okay, so let's get started. Where were we? And let me remove my headphone, because I don't require it right now.

1184
02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:19.880
Monal S: I was not able to even hear myself correctly.

1185
02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:31.780
Monal S: Okay, so this is where we were. I hope everyone is… guys, please come back here. I know everyone is excited, everyone wants to learn a lot of new things, but I want you here.

1186
02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:48.250
Monal S: Yes? Okay. So, we have… we are done with string properties, we are done with operators. Operators is finally over, we have seen all the examples. Now we will start with control flow, alright? So, let me…

1187
02:21:49.150 --> 02:21:49.870
Monal S: Yes.

1188
02:21:50.890 --> 02:21:54.090
Monal S: Guys, let's talk about things later, okay?

1189
02:21:56.310 --> 02:21:58.709
Monal S: We cannot extend every class for 6 hours.

1190
02:21:59.790 --> 02:22:00.680
Monal S: True?

1191
02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:06.610
Monal S: Control Flow.

1192
02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:09.469
Monal S: Great, guys, great. Don't worry, you will get access.

1193
02:22:10.290 --> 02:22:14.949
Monal S: So, let me give you a little bit of introduction about control flow.

1194
02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:17.100
Monal S: Just read.

1195
02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:36.949
Monal S: So, control flow is the concept, it comes with certain code, and those statements, those code statements, helps control the flow of the program, alright? So, using control flow, what we do? Using control flow, we control the

1196
02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:41.470
Monal S: Flow of the program.

1197
02:22:42.730 --> 02:22:50.719
Monal S: Alright? So right now, we have seen that the flow goes from top to bottom, right? This is the current flow.

1198
02:22:50.720 --> 02:23:04.690
Monal S: whatever is there, line by line, we need to execute it. There is no option to not execute certain line, there is no option to skip certain line, or create a flow from it, alright? There is no option right now.

1199
02:23:04.690 --> 02:23:11.650
Monal S: How many of you think that there is option? We have learned certain commands that gives us option? No. Till now, we haven't.

1200
02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:23.460
Monal S: So, using control flow, what we require, we want to con… we want the control that currently I'm here, I want to execute these three lines, then I want to check certain things based on my condition.

1201
02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:38.469
Monal S: And if that does not satisfies, I can also skip that step, skip steps, whatever steps I want, and I will be able to execute in, again, top to bottom, but I have a control of what statements to run, what statements not to run.

1202
02:23:38.770 --> 02:23:40.250
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

1203
02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:42.950
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

1204
02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:45.570
Monal S: Guys?

1205
02:23:47.450 --> 02:23:48.929
Monal S: So, it is used…

1206
02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:58.900
Monal S: to execute… everyone know what is execute? Execute and run is the same thing. It is used to execute or run

1207
02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:11.330
Monal S: blocks of code, Blocks of code on a specific conditions.

1208
02:24:14.700 --> 02:24:16.559
Monal S: Alright, specific conditions.

1209
02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:35.009
Monal S: Now, let me talk about what are the components of this control statement. It is very human, interpretable language, it is very easy to understand. So, let's suppose I'm giving you a simple task. This is your task. You don't have to do coding. Task means we will just discuss this task.

1210
02:24:35.130 --> 02:24:40.670
Monal S: So this is a task we…

1211
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:45.369
Monal S: Okay, our requirement is we need to buy

1212
02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:55.830
Monal S: 4 apples, okay? We need to buy 4 apples is our requirement. So, first thing what we will do, the first thing which we will do, we will check if

1213
02:24:56.750 --> 02:25:01.480
Monal S: Apple is greater than or equals to 4, yes?

1214
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:11.720
Monal S: This is how we do a check in real world. We will check first whether 4 apples are present in the store or not. Yes, guys, we checked this one. What we will check?

1215
02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:26.689
Monal S: weather… 4 apples… or more… are present… in the store.

1216
02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:31.190
Monal S: If 4 apples are not present, what we will do?

1217
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:34.539
Monal S: 84 apples are not present, what we will do?

1218
02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:39.060
Monal S: We will not buy the apple. This is, suppose, whatever condition is.

1219
02:25:39.370 --> 02:25:47.260
Monal S: Only if apples are present in the store, We will buy apples.

1220
02:25:47.770 --> 02:25:51.970
Monal S: But if 4 apples are not present in the store, then we will do what?

1221
02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:58.170
Monal S: Then we will do what? So this is like, if 4 apples Then…

1222
02:25:58.330 --> 02:26:08.570
Monal S: If this condition is not correct, then we will do something else. That means we will… Not… by Apple.

1223
02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:12.460
Monal S: Yes, this is how we make decisions in real world.

1224
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:14.710
Monal S: Guys, tell me!

1225
02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:19.329
Monal S: Tell me if this is how we do decision in real world or not.

1226
02:26:20.350 --> 02:26:39.619
Monal S: Yes, everyone does it in the real world every day. Do you have some person's number? Is it available? What food it is? If it is not your liking, you might not eat it, or you might order online. Everything is based on, if it is available, then we will do this. If not, then I will do something else.

1227
02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:45.990
Monal S: Similarly, In Python, we have something called as if and else.

1228
02:26:46.930 --> 02:26:53.209
Monal S: Here, we have if and else. Here, in IF, we write the condition we want.

1229
02:26:53.760 --> 02:27:00.739
Monal S: Here, we write the condition. If certain condition, then we do something else.

1230
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:06.259
Monal S: Then, if the condition satisfies, then we will do this.

1231
02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:15.239
Monal S: If the condition does not satisfy, only then we will go and do something which is written in the else spot.

1232
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:17.530
Monal S: Are we clear?

1233
02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:19.609
Monal S: Are we clear?

1234
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:30.470
Monal S: to see what I'm… how I'm going to write this in our notebook. So what we are doing…

1235
02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:37.620
Monal S: Guys, it is very simple. If and else. Only one of them runs at a time. So here, we are running…

1236
02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.249
Monal S: Conditional statements. We write it conditional statements, or…

1237
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:52.769
Monal S: Control flow. Conditional statements is a part of control flow. Control flow is kind of a generic term, but technically we call those as

1238
02:27:52.920 --> 02:28:02.379
Monal S: conditional statements, alright? This is the main technical Python language. Conditional statement. So let's say I want to check, if

1239
02:28:02.660 --> 02:28:03.579
Monal S: See this.

1240
02:28:03.810 --> 02:28:14.450
Monal S: The first I will write the problem statement as we want to give Access to Batch 1 recording.

1241
02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:22.350
Monal S: two people, Pull by… Batch, too.

1242
02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:26.649
Monal S: Yes, this is what you all are getting. So, currently, what we will say?

1243
02:28:26.770 --> 02:28:29.059
Monal S: our current batch.

1244
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:31.170
Monal S: What is our current badge, guys?

1245
02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:38.810
Monal S: What is our current batch? 2. This is batch 2. Alright? So this one, we will say, if.

1246
02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:54.829
Monal S: the current batch is greater than. Either we can write greater than, either we can write equals, or we can write greater than and equals to, because for the batch 3, we will do the same. If we don't want to give the same to the batch 3, then we will write

1247
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.910
Monal S: this.

1248
02:28:57.050 --> 02:29:03.519
Monal S: Are we able to understand when to use double equals to? Greater than at equals to, and double equals to? There is a difference.

1249
02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:16.350
Monal S: This one will only be active for batch 2, but if you want to give everyone who is greater than a request to batch 2, then I will be using this. But for now, only for batch 2. Then here, what I will do, I will write.

1250
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:24.790
Monal S: Access to Ultimate Data Science Batch 1.0.

1251
02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:26.930
Monal S: also provided.

1252
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:35.969
Monal S: If the student is not from batch 2, else does not have a condition, else is like, if it's not true, then what?

1253
02:29:36.330 --> 02:29:48.160
Monal S: Then what? Then we will say… You only have… Access to Badge 1.0.

1254
02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:51.820
Monal S: Yes?

1255
02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:55.709
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand how the coding is going to flow?

1256
02:29:55.850 --> 02:29:58.079
Monal S: If has certain condition.

1257
02:29:58.350 --> 02:30:09.309
Monal S: If a certain condition, then we need to write the colon. Guys, this is called as colon, then we need to write the colon. Colon tells Python that whatever we are going to write after that.

1258
02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:21.799
Monal S: alright, is going to be the part of if… I will tell you the syntax, don't worry, I will tell you the syntax, but first understand the flow. Then we will talk about the syntax. But is everyone able to understand the high level, how the flow looks like?

1259
02:30:21.980 --> 02:30:24.199
Monal S: Only if this is true.

1260
02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:32.150
Monal S: Only if this is true, then this will happen. So, if you just write true as well, Python will work.

1261
02:30:32.410 --> 02:30:51.369
Monal S: If only requires true to be present here. Either you write true from some condition, or just write basic dummy true. If it is basic dummy true, else will never run. Why? Because only one of them runs at a time. Either if will run, either else will run. Is everyone clear?

1262
02:30:52.430 --> 02:30:53.910
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

1263
02:30:54.630 --> 02:31:05.059
Monal S: Without colon, it will not work. Colon is the requirement. We'll talk about syntax, guys. So, if only requires true, when it is true, then it will work.

1264
02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:23.720
Monal S: But if it is false, then this will not work, else will work. So let me go back to the condition, and you guys will tell me if the condition is true or not. Tell me if the condition is true or not. Guys, I will repeat everything, don't worry. You will first see the execution, then I will show you the flow.

1265
02:31:24.260 --> 02:31:26.609
Monal S: Currently, this condition is true.

1266
02:31:26.810 --> 02:31:28.470
Monal S: So this one will work.

1267
02:31:28.730 --> 02:31:32.740
Monal S: So let's see… Are we getting the same thing?

1268
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:37.310
Monal S: See this? Okay, something is wrong here. What is going on? Yes.

1269
02:31:37.870 --> 02:31:38.990
Monal S: It is working.

1270
02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:41.090
Monal S: Is it working?

1271
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:42.800
Monal S: It is true.

1272
02:31:44.350 --> 02:31:50.710
Monal S: But if batch is equals to 3, then this one will be… this one will be false.

1273
02:31:51.280 --> 02:32:00.239
Monal S: When the current batch is 3, this one will be false. If this is false, we will not go and check this, we will go to the final thing.

1274
02:32:00.350 --> 02:32:03.849
Monal S: Batch is not 3, then do what? Then we will do this.

1275
02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:06.000
Monal S: Is it working?

1276
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:08.650
Monal S: Are we able to control the flow?

1277
02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:12.610
Monal S: Are we able to control the flow?

1278
02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:16.029
Monal S: Yeah, first check it.

1279
02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:21.229
Monal S: Anuraq, check the arrow why it is wrong. You have written something wrong.

1280
02:32:21.730 --> 02:32:26.679
Monal S: Alright? So we are able to control the flow. Now let's talk about the syntax.

1281
02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:32.990
Monal S: Okay? This is not as simple… it is simple, but it is not as simple, but I want everyone's focus to be present here.

1282
02:32:33.310 --> 02:32:39.780
Monal S: This is what we call a syntax of something. We need to write the keyword of Python called as if.

1283
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:46.009
Monal S: Then we provide some kind of a condition. Condition we can provide in bracket, it is also fine.

1284
02:32:46.270 --> 02:32:49.529
Monal S: This is condition. Then we need to write colon.

1285
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:58.180
Monal S: Alright? Then we'll write colon. When you press enter, you will see that Python will not start from here. See this?

1286
02:32:58.780 --> 02:33:01.670
Monal S: If I mention something like, if true.

1287
02:33:01.890 --> 02:33:06.430
Monal S: After colon, if I press enter, it is not starting from here.

1288
02:33:07.170 --> 02:33:18.320
Monal S: This is automatic indentation Python is providing. Here, you will see, we need to start the code, whatever we want to do when the condition is true, we will write it here.

1289
02:33:18.850 --> 02:33:24.839
Monal S: If you start writing from here, Python will not consider it as a part of if.

1290
02:33:25.690 --> 02:33:34.139
Monal S: Are we clear? If we start writing from here, this line as the if, Python will not consider it as a part of if.

1291
02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:40.539
Monal S: it will consider it as a part of normal Python code, which we were doing till now.

1292
02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:53.949
Monal S: Are we clear? So, to make it as a block of if, a part of if, we provide this indentation. This empty space which we are getting is called as indentation.

1293
02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:55.700
Monal S: Say this.

1294
02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:01.439
Monal S: This empty space that we have.

1295
02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:05.800
Monal S: This is nothing but… indentation.

1296
02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:07.699
Monal S: Are we clear, everyone?

1297
02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:10.799
Monal S: This space via clear.

1298
02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:26.110
Monal S: Okay, we can write 100 lines of code inside this block, that is also totally fine. Whatever you want to do when the condition is true, you can write it here like a normal Python. There is no constraint. But if you don't provide this colon, it will not work.

1299
02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:38.439
Monal S: Once all the… once this condition is true, if the condition is true, Python will execute all the lines of code present here, then it will look for what is the next line of code.

1300
02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:40.080
Monal S: Else!

1301
02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:43.359
Monal S: I will show you, okay? Else.

1302
02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:49.740
Monal S: And else will have its own block.

1303
02:34:50.100 --> 02:35:01.630
Monal S: ELSE does not have a condition because we have written the condition in the if block. After colon, again, we will see the indentation. It means whatever we are going to write here is a part of else block.

1304
02:35:01.770 --> 02:35:05.490
Monal S: So this is how the Python will work. I will show you, okay? See this code.

1305
02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:12.799
Monal S: Everyone, focus. Current batch is 3. Python will execute, save the 3 into the current batch.

1306
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:27.399
Monal S: Next line, it is empty. Next line, it is a if block. It will check if the current batch is equals to… if this condition, this is a condition, if current batch is equals to 2, what is the answer of this?

1307
02:35:27.870 --> 02:35:29.640
Monal S: What is the answer of this?

1308
02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:32.200
Monal S: Tell me.

1309
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:35.270
Monal S: 2 is equals to 2… 3 is equals to 2?

1310
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:41.230
Monal S: Is 3 is equals to 2? No, it is false. So…

1311
02:36:11.090 --> 02:36:15.269
Monal S: So whenever if is failed, else will run.

1312
02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:18.089
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand the flow?

1313
02:36:18.830 --> 02:36:21.529
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand the flow? Very simple.

1314
02:36:22.930 --> 02:36:26.110
Monal S: Now comes a different part. See this?

1315
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:39.039
Monal S: if can exist without the else as well, and you can write other part of code as well. Just similar, like, A is equals to 2, B is equal to 2, now you are doing print of A plus 4.

1316
02:36:39.860 --> 02:36:52.720
Monal S: What we are doing, we are just… we… here we have assigned the value of 3 to the variable. We are checking something. If this is false, Python will… first, is 3 equals to 2? False.

1317
02:36:52.930 --> 02:36:54.790
Monal S: Will Python go inside?

1318
02:36:55.140 --> 02:37:04.919
Monal S: Will Python go inside? No, Python is not going to go inside the if block. What is the next line of code? Empty. What is the next line of code? A equals to 2.

1319
02:37:05.250 --> 02:37:07.400
Monal S: It will keep on executing.

1320
02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:12.390
Monal S: Do we require else here in this case? We don't need else.

1321
02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:15.850
Monal S: But if is required.

1322
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:24.909
Monal S: So if I run it, what I will see? I will not see access to UDS batch, I will just see 4, because it is this line of code.

1323
02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:26.310
Monal S: Yes?

1324
02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:29.239
Monal S: Is everyone able to interpret the code?

1325
02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:31.600
Monal S: Everyone is able to interpret the code.

1326
02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:35.180
Monal S: Next!

1327
02:37:36.350 --> 02:37:38.670
Monal S: If I just write else.

1328
02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:45.349
Monal S: Else does not have a condition. Else means if something does not work, then do this.

1329
02:37:45.710 --> 02:37:53.249
Monal S: But if I don't even have the condition, it means then do this. How it is different from just simple print.

1330
02:37:54.770 --> 02:38:01.410
Monal S: So, else will not exist without a if block. You cannot have else. You can see we are getting error.

1331
02:38:02.530 --> 02:38:04.059
Monal S: Are you able to see error?

1332
02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:09.250
Monal S: Because if we only have else, how different it is from just writing simple print?

1333
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:11.200
Monal S: Make sense?

1334
02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:17.149
Monal S: So, else… should exist only with IF.

1335
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:24.110
Monal S: Else cannot exist without a if block.

1336
02:38:24.510 --> 02:38:26.799
Monal S: Guys, very straightforward.

1337
02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:39.909
Monal S: ELSE cannot exist without an IF. For else to work, you require if block. If certain kind of a condition, you will write just like this.

1338
02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:43.790
Monal S: If current batch is equals to 2.

1339
02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:46.740
Monal S: Then we will do something, let's print hello.

1340
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:48.639
Monal S: Only print hello. Dummy thing.

1341
02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.430
Monal S: Now you can see error is gone.

1342
02:38:51.820 --> 02:38:57.129
Monal S: Now you can see error is gone. So what are acceptable ways to write block?

1343
02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:03.530
Monal S: You can write if… condition…

1344
02:39:03.890 --> 02:39:12.419
Monal S: and its block, and else, and its block. This is one way. Another way is, you can write a condition

1345
02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:22.099
Monal S: And then a block. This is another way. But you cannot write else alone, because it does not even make sense.

1346
02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:28.829
Monal S: So, these two are accepted.

1347
02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:31.769
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

1348
02:39:34.570 --> 02:39:36.030
Monal S: Guys, tell me…

1349
02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:46.190
Monal S: In real world, you will ask a question that whether you have 4 apples, you need to buy 4 apples. The first thing is, you will check whether the store has 4 apples or not.

1350
02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:51.069
Monal S: In real world, will you directly not buy the apple when the requirement is apple?

1351
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:55.089
Monal S: In real world, will you directly go to the end condition.

1352
02:39:56.700 --> 02:40:01.690
Monal S: I need to buy Apple, I will not buy Apple. Does it make sense? You never checked it.

1353
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:10.529
Monal S: In real world, there needs to be a condition first, whether it is available or not. If I ask, if you guys ask me my email.

1354
02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:18.360
Monal S: The first thing is, I have to provide it. Avilu directly says, sir, I have your email.

1355
02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:20.060
Monal S: Can you say that?

1356
02:40:20.330 --> 02:40:22.800
Monal S: Sir, I have your email, without even asking.

1357
02:40:23.170 --> 02:40:30.659
Monal S: Does it make sense in real world? Similarly, in Python, if you're asking a question, sir, can we have else alone?

1358
02:40:30.850 --> 02:40:33.789
Monal S: Just think for a second, what does it even mean?

1359
02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:46.489
Monal S: Else does not even have a condition. If something does not have a condition, it will run always. If something run always, why not use the code directly? Why use else?

1360
02:40:48.010 --> 02:40:49.570
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

1361
02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:52.370
Monal S: Is everyone able to relate?

1362
02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:59.949
Monal S: So, guys, indentation is nothing but tab, you can see.

1363
02:41:00.170 --> 02:41:03.070
Monal S: How many dots you're able to see here, tell me.

1364
02:41:03.330 --> 02:41:05.490
Monal S: How many dots you are able to see?

1365
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:10.639
Monal S: In my code, 4 dots means 4 space.

1366
02:41:10.810 --> 02:41:18.730
Monal S: So, this is just like a py… your keyboard tab part. One tab is equals to four spaces.

1367
02:41:19.690 --> 02:41:24.949
Monal S: Either you press 1 tab, either you press 4 tab if Python does not provide. See this?

1368
02:41:25.530 --> 02:41:28.310
Monal S: Let's say I delete. If true.

1369
02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:48.869
Monal S: I have mentioned the colon, then pressed enter. This is already an indentation which my IDE VS code is providing. But if I delete this tab, I can either press Tab as a button, you can see tab in your keyboard, or you can press 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 tabs in order for it to work.

1370
02:41:49.330 --> 02:41:52.339
Monal S: Not… not colon, but print something. Print hello.

1371
02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:55.650
Monal S: See, right now I've written 4 spaces.

1372
02:41:55.780 --> 02:41:57.949
Monal S: Is it working? It's working.

1373
02:41:58.330 --> 02:42:01.910
Monal S: If I remove everything, press one tab, it's also working.

1374
02:42:03.890 --> 02:42:06.370
Monal S: It works with two spaces also.

1375
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:17.480
Monal S: But don't always use two spaces, because that is not the standard. Indentation means Python just need a way to understand that which code belongs to the if block.

1376
02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:24.700
Monal S: If I remove all the space, how you're going to differentiate which belongs to Python, which belongs to your normal code like this?

1377
02:42:25.270 --> 02:42:31.270
Monal S: This is our normal code. How Python is going to understand that something belongs to the if block.

1378
02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:34.300
Monal S: Only with the help of indentation.

1379
02:42:34.770 --> 02:42:41.189
Monal S: So now Python know that if indentation is present, it means this print is a part of this condition.

1380
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:43.220
Monal S: Are we clear?

1381
02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:49.009
Monal S: Are we clear, everyone? I'm not going to repeat this.

1382
02:42:51.410 --> 02:42:57.190
Monal S: So, yes, you can write if without a else block, it is totally acceptable.

1383
02:42:57.850 --> 02:42:59.650
Monal S: It is totally acceptable.

1384
02:43:01.690 --> 02:43:09.209
Monal S: Okay, now I'm going to give you a condition, how to make things better, software development better, or user experience better.

1385
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:13.840
Monal S: The task is…

1386
02:43:17.130 --> 02:43:20.480
Monal S: You, as a developer are creating an application

1387
02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:30.020
Monal S: You as a developer is creating an application or tool our tool, Which will help you

1388
02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:34.190
Monal S: connect to a Wi-Fi.

1389
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:40.060
Monal S: Which will help you connect to our Wi-Fi. Now, tell me which one is better. Option 1.

1390
02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:51.530
Monal S: If Wi-Fi available, Connect it. I'm just writing without a coding, but just a syntax, okay?

1391
02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:58.140
Monal S: If… See this. If… Wi-Fi available.

1392
02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:00.819
Monal S: Then we will connect.

1393
02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:04.750
Monal S: This is option 1. Okay, let me erase this and write option 1.

1394
02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:06.100
Monal S: better.

1395
02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:09.660
Monal S: This is option 1.

1396
02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:11.160
Monal S: Option 2.

1397
02:44:14.170 --> 02:44:19.250
Monal S: If… Wi-Fi available.

1398
02:44:19.650 --> 02:44:20.690
Monal S: Connect.

1399
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:23.800
Monal S: Else?

1400
02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:32.910
Monal S: tell user… No Wi-Fi available.

1401
02:44:33.970 --> 02:44:36.559
Monal S: You as a customer, which one do you want?

1402
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:39.670
Monal S: You as a customer, which one do you want?

1403
02:44:41.060 --> 02:44:45.190
Monal S: Why you don't want option 1? Can you tell me why you don't want option 1?

1404
02:44:45.370 --> 02:44:48.240
Monal S: Because it is not user-friendly.

1405
02:44:48.850 --> 02:44:59.760
Monal S: If user wants to connect to Wi-Fi, and that application will never tell us that, no, Wi-Fi is available, you are not able to connect, then user will be like, okay, my Wi-Fi is available, but my internet is not working.

1406
02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:12.750
Monal S: So, option 2 is more user-friendly. Although else can work without if, if you're… it depends on the developer. If you want to provide a better experience, maybe do something else, if something is not working.

1407
02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:23.960
Monal S: Encoding, you will use this as well, this as well, but again, based on the scenario. Wherever you want to make friendly, make it this. Wherever you only want to check, use this.

1408
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:31.299
Monal S: Are we clear? Both of them are important, but where you want to use it totally depends on you.

1409
02:45:32.270 --> 02:45:40.150
Monal S: This is Control Flow, but this is, again, in today's topic, I told you about control flow.

1410
02:45:41.420 --> 02:45:44.299
Monal S: That we have two different levels.

1411
02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:58.730
Monal S: Alright? Can we jump to the next one? Everyone, are we ready for the next one? Simple! It is also simple, but this time, it is a little advanced on the basic effects.

1412
02:45:59.290 --> 02:46:00.090
Monal S: Okay?

1413
02:46:02.370 --> 02:46:03.330
Monal S: Say this.

1414
02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:08.580
Monal S: Now we are going to control flow too. We have done a lot of things today, right?

1415
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:11.879
Monal S: You guys are enjoying the class?

1416
02:46:12.450 --> 02:46:13.290
Monal S: Yep.

1417
02:46:16.170 --> 02:46:23.959
Monal S: Control Flow 2. There is nothing like Control Flow 2, but I'm just dividing it to beginner and advanced part, alright?

1418
02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:29.400
Monal S: So, the basic part was, if… if…

1419
02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:34.889
Monal S: condition, I'm just going to write it in short. If condition, then we have something.

1420
02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:36.960
Monal S: Then we'd do something.

1421
02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:39.950
Monal S: Do something.

1422
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:43.330
Monal S: Again, do something.

1423
02:46:44.700 --> 02:46:50.290
Monal S: We have also seen simple if condition, Do something.

1424
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:57.430
Monal S: But in real world, we don't just have condition, then do something.

1425
02:46:57.890 --> 02:47:07.419
Monal S: It's like, if my requirement is to buy 4 apples, if the shop does not have 4 apples, if the shop does not have 4 apples.

1426
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:12.509
Monal S: Either I can go home, or I can just buy 3 apples. Yes or no?

1427
02:47:13.570 --> 02:47:14.730
Monal S: Yes or no?

1428
02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:17.670
Monal S: Or we can go to our next shop.

1429
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:27.110
Monal S: In real world, we don't just have one condition and one final thing if we don't satisfy the condition. In real world, we do have multiple levels.

1430
02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:29.120
Monal S: Yes?

1431
02:47:29.490 --> 02:47:34.790
Monal S: We do have multiple levels. Similarly, control flow have multiple levels.

1432
02:47:35.130 --> 02:47:36.140
Monal S: See this?

1433
02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:41.679
Monal S: If condition is present, this is the first thing, do something.

1434
02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:51.540
Monal S: If this condition does not satisfies, instead of doing the final thing, maybe we can check for another condition.

1435
02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:54.230
Monal S: We call it as LIF.

1436
02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:58.739
Monal S: Say this, we call it as… L if.

1437
02:47:59.510 --> 02:48:02.989
Monal S: And again, write a condition and do something.

1438
02:48:05.410 --> 02:48:11.630
Monal S: We can write as much ALIF as possible, as much required as possible.

1439
02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:15.619
Monal S: It can be hundred, it can be thousand, it can be two.

1440
02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:23.730
Monal S: And if we want, we can write else, but else is, again, an optional one.

1441
02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:41.410
Monal S: If you think none of the conditions satisfies, and you want to do still something, then you will go with ELF. Otherwise, if you want multiple conditions to be tested, you will do this. But you cannot have ELIF alone without having if.

1442
02:48:41.850 --> 02:48:43.860
Monal S: This is not acceptable.

1443
02:48:44.590 --> 02:48:49.090
Monal S: You require if in order to write the LIF. Is everyone clear?

1444
02:48:51.250 --> 02:48:56.730
Monal S: Indentation is always… guys, tell me, why do we require indentation? I told you.

1445
02:48:57.830 --> 02:49:01.050
Monal S: What is the meaning of indentation to a programming language?

1446
02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:11.100
Monal S: So that it can differentiate which part belongs to something.

1447
02:49:12.140 --> 02:49:13.490
Monal S: Are we clear?

1448
02:49:13.950 --> 02:49:29.870
Monal S: which part belongs to something, to understand which block, which area belongs to some condition. That's why indentation is there. In if, again, if I not provide indentation, what will happen? Same error, not error. Same thing, Python will not be able to understand.

1449
02:49:30.090 --> 02:49:36.749
Monal S: So, understand the concept, No, my question is, if Alif has to start with indentation.

1450
02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:44.640
Monal S: No, it is on the same. Guys, see this. If, LF, LF, LF, else, all of them have the same level.

1451
02:49:45.150 --> 02:49:48.130
Monal S: Just like if and else belongs to the same level.

1452
02:49:49.570 --> 02:49:54.229
Monal S: Are you clear? Guys, this is not Java, we don't require these blocks.

1453
02:49:55.340 --> 02:49:57.320
Monal S: In Python, we don't require it.

1454
02:49:59.270 --> 02:50:03.370
Monal S: Another one, this is not acceptable, so let me mark it as cross.

1455
02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:04.640
Monal S: another.

1456
02:50:04.970 --> 02:50:09.959
Monal S: This is if, Aleph, Aleph, and this is also Aleph, okay?

1457
02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:14.880
Monal S: I also wanted to tell you one more thing.

1458
02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:27.039
Monal S: Rohit, because Python developers don't require it, indentation is the curly braces. In Java, you don't require indentation.

1459
02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:28.620
Monal S: Rohit, yes?

1460
02:50:29.550 --> 02:50:35.969
Monal S: Java uses curly brackets to define the area. Python uses indentation to define the area.

1461
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:45.139
Monal S: Now, people are asking, what is elif? LIF is just like IF, but it will only work with if.

1462
02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:56.319
Monal S: If this, I will tell you guys, I will tell you. Okay, there are a lot of Rohit, yes. Don't worry, guys, I will tell you. See this example? Only after example, we will understand what to do with that, okay?

1463
02:50:57.740 --> 02:51:01.160
Monal S: Say this. Where is our code? Here is the code.

1464
02:51:01.870 --> 02:51:09.380
Monal S: Now we are in control flow 2, or I will just write… If… I live else.

1465
02:51:11.370 --> 02:51:12.550
Monal S: Now see this.

1466
02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:16.650
Monal S: I am going to define operation name.

1467
02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:22.730
Monal S: Okay? And here, we will write something. This was marked down, let me select it as Python.

1468
02:51:24.130 --> 02:51:32.440
Monal S: Okay, sometimes this Python becomes marked down. So, see this, what I'm trying to do, then you will understand when to use it, where to use it.

1469
02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:39.490
Monal S: If… The operation name is equals to add.

1470
02:51:39.980 --> 02:51:43.349
Monal S: Just like a calculator. Then we will print.

1471
02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:47.020
Monal S: Perform addition.

1472
02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:50.780
Monal S: Only one condition.

1473
02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:54.649
Monal S: Alright? Now, suppose I want to have multiple conditions.

1474
02:51:56.350 --> 02:51:58.310
Monal S: I will write LF.

1475
02:52:00.490 --> 02:52:07.690
Monal S: If operation is equal to subtract, We will perform subtraction.

1476
02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:13.840
Monal S: Else?

1477
02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:21.170
Monal S: Let's do… no operation.

1478
02:52:22.610 --> 02:52:24.070
Monal S: Name found.

1479
02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:31.339
Monal S: No selected operation name form.

1480
02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:39.970
Monal S: So, let's define operation name as data.

1481
02:52:40.690 --> 02:52:48.629
Monal S: Now, see one by one, everyone. I'm not going to repeat it. I am not going to repeat it. I know a lot of people are here in the chat. Guys, please focus here.

1482
02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:52.510
Monal S: Data is operation name, operation name have data.

1483
02:52:52.760 --> 02:52:55.699
Monal S: Tell me, is this condition true?

1484
02:52:56.250 --> 02:53:00.890
Monal S: Is this condition true? Is data equals to add? False.

1485
02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:02.350
Monal S: If false.

1486
02:53:02.650 --> 02:53:11.299
Monal S: Python will go inside here, yes or no? Python will not go inside and execute. What is the next line? Next line is elif.

1487
02:53:12.270 --> 02:53:16.300
Monal S: Here, what we are doing… Is data ecosystem subtract?

1488
02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:23.420
Monal S: No, false. Python will not go inside, check in the same level, what is the next code? Next code is else.

1489
02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:27.369
Monal S: Else does not have any condition, it means it will work always.

1490
02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:31.309
Monal S: It will work only when the above conditions are false.

1491
02:53:31.570 --> 02:53:41.340
Monal S: Guys, make sure that you remember this. ELSE will only work when above condition are false. If any of the condition is true, we will not even go to else.

1492
02:53:42.510 --> 02:53:43.480
Monal S: Yes?

1493
02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:46.220
Monal S: I hope everyone understood this before.

1494
02:53:48.330 --> 02:53:55.299
Monal S: So, because both the conditions are false, we will go to else and say, no selected operation name found.

1495
02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:58.430
Monal S: Parking?

1496
02:53:58.740 --> 02:54:04.240
Monal S: Let's add another ALIF to make it More, bigger. Divide.

1497
02:54:05.780 --> 02:54:07.700
Monal S: perform division.

1498
02:54:08.890 --> 02:54:10.440
Monal S: Same thing will happen.

1499
02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:16.519
Monal S: it will not work. None of the conditions are getting satisfied. Now, if I do divide.

1500
02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:18.650
Monal S: If I do divide.

1501
02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:37.839
Monal S: This one will not work, condition does not satisfies. When it will go to the second L if, condition is not satisfying. When it will go to elif, this will work. Once it is true, it will not even go to the else block. This is considered it as whole control flow, one control flow block.

1502
02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:40.350
Monal S: After that, we can print.

1503
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:44.900
Monal S: Program ended.

1504
02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:59.169
Monal S: So what we will see, guys, if any of them here is true, it will… it will do the work inside it, and then go to the same level and jump out of… this is the whole control flow. I will write in comments.

1505
02:54:59.470 --> 02:55:07.459
Monal S: This is Control Flow Start, And in else block, control flow ends.

1506
02:55:10.140 --> 02:55:22.439
Monal S: So, what we found, when the operation name is Divide, this one worked, it performed the code written inside it, then we jump to the… we jump out of the control flow.

1507
02:55:22.750 --> 02:55:24.559
Monal S: So, what we have seen…

1508
02:55:28.310 --> 02:55:41.929
Monal S: If any of the condition is true, it will do the job. Then, after doing the job, it will not do any check. It will jump out of the code in the same level after the control flow.

1509
02:55:46.860 --> 02:55:53.290
Monal S: Sir, what if we remove else and don't use print statement outside the go? Guys, what will happen? You're asking?

1510
02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:54.960
Monal S: What will happen now?

1511
02:55:55.990 --> 02:56:00.479
Monal S: What will happen now? We will only see the work of perform division.

1512
02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:05.280
Monal S: Is there any code after the control flow? No code, it will do nothing.

1513
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:10.699
Monal S: Yes, Priya, I will talk about it.

1514
02:56:12.970 --> 02:56:14.940
Monal S: Is this part clear, guys?

1515
02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:23.649
Monal S: Guys, if you don't use else, Are you getting error?

1516
02:56:23.870 --> 02:56:26.010
Monal S: People are saying we are getting error.

1517
02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:38.420
Monal S: Now, the next part, the final part, then will give you… guys, control flow can work. It does not give you error.

1518
02:56:38.670 --> 02:56:47.080
Monal S: Now, people will ask, there is a certain kind of a thing. There are a lot of permutation combinations. I hope everyone is clear with this combination.

1519
02:56:47.450 --> 02:56:49.999
Monal S: Everyone is clear with this combination.

1520
02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:52.799
Monal S: Yes Now, the next code.

1521
02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:55.240
Monal S: Why not use…

1522
02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:02.569
Monal S: Why not use multiple if, why use ELIF?

1523
02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:07.040
Monal S: How many of you have this question?

1524
02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:11.439
Monal S: Why not use multiple if when we have…

1525
02:57:11.860 --> 02:57:14.080
Monal S: When we have it, why to use LIF?

1526
02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:32.640
Monal S: The answer lies in start and end block. Guys, Whenever we start if, It starts… It starts… Control… flow…

1527
02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:34.280
Monal S: block.

1528
02:57:36.250 --> 02:57:42.790
Monal S: Whenever a new again starts, it again starts… A new control flow.

1529
02:57:43.750 --> 02:57:44.510
Monal S: block.

1530
02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:50.840
Monal S: Again, we saw… Again, it starts…

1531
02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:57.330
Monal S: And here, if I write ALIF, Here, if I write Aleph.

1532
02:57:59.710 --> 02:58:02.760
Monal S: And again, if I write another if condition.

1533
02:58:03.860 --> 02:58:07.130
Monal S: Then this block will end here.

1534
02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:10.919
Monal S: And here we will get a new start.

1535
02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:20.239
Monal S: So whenever we get a new if, whenever we get a new if, guys, it starts a new block. What will happen in a new block? Say this.

1536
02:58:20.370 --> 02:58:24.319
Monal S: As I mentioned, this is a new block. Is this part clear, guys?

1537
02:58:24.450 --> 02:58:27.559
Monal S: This whole thing is a new block. Is this part clear?

1538
02:58:29.070 --> 02:58:30.659
Monal S: Is this part clear?

1539
02:58:32.670 --> 02:58:34.230
Monal S: Now, see what will happen.

1540
02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:39.860
Monal S: Let me copy everything.

1541
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:46.070
Monal S: And this time, I will write it as if.

1542
02:58:46.500 --> 02:58:54.950
Monal S: So this one means control flow ended here. Is this part clear? Control flow ended here? Because we are getting new if. Is this part clear?

1543
02:58:57.060 --> 02:58:59.260
Monal S: When a new if is introduced.

1544
02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:04.079
Monal S: Control flow we start. So, how many blocks of control flow we have here?

1545
02:59:04.380 --> 02:59:07.430
Monal S: How many blocks of control flow we have here? Two.

1546
02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:09.730
Monal S: Now, see what will happen.

1547
02:59:10.490 --> 02:59:12.659
Monal S: Operation is equals to divide.

1548
02:59:12.820 --> 02:59:15.059
Monal S: Is operation is equals to divide.

1549
02:59:15.250 --> 02:59:17.350
Monal S: Is operation is equals to divide?

1550
02:59:17.890 --> 02:59:18.810
Monal S: False.

1551
02:59:18.930 --> 02:59:21.210
Monal S: It will not go inside.

1552
02:59:21.350 --> 02:59:23.930
Monal S: But it will not jump to the end.

1553
02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:29.789
Monal S: It will jump to the next line in the level where the control flow ended.

1554
02:59:31.890 --> 02:59:39.080
Monal S: Okay, see this? Control flow ended here. Now it will again start if operation is equals to divide? No.

1555
02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:47.900
Monal S: it will not perform this, it will perform this, and you will see this code. But see now, when I do add.

1556
02:59:48.770 --> 02:59:54.100
Monal S: when I do add, And again, let me add this code here as well.

1557
02:59:55.090 --> 02:59:56.630
Monal S: Multiple blocks.

1558
02:59:57.240 --> 03:00:00.580
Monal S: Still tell me how many control flows we have, guys.

1559
03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:04.489
Monal S: How many control flows we have here now? Still two.

1560
03:00:04.890 --> 03:00:07.090
Monal S: Operation name is equals to add.

1561
03:00:07.540 --> 03:00:08.910
Monal S: Will this work?

1562
03:00:09.230 --> 03:00:10.790
Monal S: Will this work?

1563
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:15.629
Monal S: We will see perform addition here.

1564
03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:19.779
Monal S: Is the block ended? Is the block ended?

1565
03:00:21.350 --> 03:00:32.329
Monal S: block ended, we are here. Now, Python will again start, because this is a new if, it will again check, and will this work? Will this work?

1566
03:00:33.530 --> 03:00:34.949
Monal S: We will see add.

1567
03:00:35.490 --> 03:00:36.930
Monal S: We will see add.

1568
03:00:37.170 --> 03:00:40.080
Monal S: So, we will see perform addition two times.

1569
03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:45.899
Monal S: And now, see the fun thing? If I make it as a LFIF,

1570
03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:56.139
Monal S: Now, although we have two same conditions, only one will work. Why? First of all, operation name is equals to add.

1571
03:00:56.380 --> 03:00:57.819
Monal S: Is this true?

1572
03:00:58.600 --> 03:00:59.979
Monal S: Is this true?

1573
03:01:02.330 --> 03:01:08.749
Monal S: Because there is no F, It will be a single block. Are we able to understand now?

1574
03:01:09.170 --> 03:01:26.559
Monal S: It is now a single if, single block. Will it go to the next one? Will it go to the next one? It will not go, because in a block of if-elif-else, only one of them is true, and then it will directly jump after the control flow. Ended.

1575
03:01:27.140 --> 03:01:29.710
Monal S: So, it will only work one time.

1576
03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:32.840
Monal S: So, if marks…

1577
03:01:33.150 --> 03:01:41.469
Monal S: if marks a new start of the control flow, Python, if sees another if, that is another if condition, it will again check.

1578
03:01:42.290 --> 03:01:53.920
Monal S: But here, only one of them is true in a block. In the previous case, when I talked about it, here we have two control flow. It will do check two times.

1579
03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:02.110
Monal S: How… when to use Double AF? Guys, when to use Double AF? Let's see.

1580
03:02:02.830 --> 03:02:05.989
Monal S: Age is equals to 19.

1581
03:02:07.100 --> 03:02:11.840
Monal S: And, batch is equals to 2.

1582
03:02:12.490 --> 03:02:14.490
Monal S: And let's say, now…

1583
03:02:18.790 --> 03:02:23.819
Monal S: Passion number is equals to, guide, what session it is, is it third class or fourth class?

1584
03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:27.180
Monal S: Is it 3rd or 4th? 3rd class?

1585
03:02:27.290 --> 03:02:31.479
Monal S: Fourth from the, main class, right?

1586
03:02:32.310 --> 03:02:35.980
Monal S: Second, actually, guys, it is for, we have orientation also, right?

1587
03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:42.039
Monal S: See this? If age is greater than 19, They will say…

1588
03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:48.280
Monal S: They will print something. Let's say I'm printing 19. I'm only printing dummy thing, we don't want to waste time.

1589
03:02:48.530 --> 03:02:57.349
Monal S: Now we want to check something else, so we will check… If badge is… greater than 1.0.

1590
03:02:57.770 --> 03:03:05.420
Monal S: Then, we will say… in double codes, give access to V1.0

1591
03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:09.240
Monal S: Then we will do another check.

1592
03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:12.780
Monal S: If session number is equals to…

1593
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:16.309
Monal S: Greater than 1, they will print.

1594
03:03:16.810 --> 03:03:18.240
Monal S: Induction and data.

1595
03:03:24.110 --> 03:03:25.459
Monal S: Are we clear?

1596
03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:32.059
Monal S: See, here we are working with different, different values to check different conditions.

1597
03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:39.609
Monal S: Here, we will check if any of them is true. Here, we are doing multiple conditions. Are you able to find a difference?

1598
03:03:41.390 --> 03:03:47.519
Monal S: See, here we have two prints because this is one block, this is another block, this is another block.

1599
03:03:49.290 --> 03:03:52.079
Monal S: How many blocks we have here? One block?

1600
03:03:52.610 --> 03:03:56.740
Monal S: 2 block, 3 block. How many blocks we have here?

1601
03:03:56.980 --> 03:03:59.390
Monal S: one block, 2 block.

1602
03:03:59.650 --> 03:04:01.650
Monal S: How many blocks we have here?

1603
03:04:01.900 --> 03:04:02.970
Monal S: One block.

1604
03:04:06.030 --> 03:04:14.469
Monal S: So guys… This is how we should understand coding. Let me write it, block start, block end.

1605
03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:20.679
Monal S: I'm giving some space so that it will… it is clear for you to remember it later.

1606
03:04:30.990 --> 03:04:32.470
Monal S: Are we clear?

1607
03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:34.560
Monal S: Are we clear?

1608
03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:52.120
Monal S: The difference is what we are trying to do. If we understand the fundamental of if and else, then it makes sense. We are asking the question because a lot of if confuses us with if-elif-elif.

1609
03:04:53.600 --> 03:05:02.109
Monal S: Someone is asking why 19 is not printed, because age is… guys, Is 19 greater than 19?

1610
03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:06.420
Monal S: Is 19 greater than 19?

1611
03:05:07.180 --> 03:05:09.889
Monal S: 19 is equals to 19.

1612
03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:17.440
Monal S: So, greater than will not work. In order for it to work, you can use either this or this.

1613
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:19.390
Monal S: Are we clear?

1614
03:05:20.050 --> 03:05:24.270
Monal S: Guys, ask that question. Is 19 greater than 19? No, it can't be.

1615
03:05:25.410 --> 03:05:27.330
Monal S: I hope everyone is clear.

1616
03:05:27.930 --> 03:05:32.069
Monal S: Guys, it requires little practice, but is everyone clear?

1617
03:05:35.930 --> 03:05:42.080
Monal S: Difference here is… Guys, what is different between Ali for switch? Switch is also there in Vita.

1618
03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:44.380
Monal S: Devanishi.

1619
03:05:44.970 --> 03:05:47.499
Monal S: Guys, similar to Switch, we have something.

1620
03:05:47.800 --> 03:05:48.620
Monal S: Okay?

1621
03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:51.429
Monal S: We'll talk about that later, not now.

1622
03:05:52.120 --> 03:06:02.850
Monal S: So guys, if-else also has something called as nested, but in today's class, it will create little chaos, okay? So, nested, if and else, we will understand it later.

1623
03:06:03.420 --> 03:06:04.710
Monal S: Is that fine?

1624
03:06:06.640 --> 03:06:09.009
Monal S: Or do you want to understand nested if-else?

1625
03:06:11.640 --> 03:06:21.780
Monal S: We will understand in depth, guys, okay? We will understand in depth. We can… we are done with control flow. In Control Flow 2, I will give you more assignments there.

1626
03:06:22.010 --> 03:06:29.100
Monal S: But what we will do, I will start with primitive, just the introduction, but we will complete the primitive in Wednesday class.

1627
03:06:30.580 --> 03:06:34.100
Monal S: Okay? So guys, see this. Understand the next topic.

1628
03:06:37.420 --> 03:06:41.710
Monal S: We are covering a lot of things. I know there will be a lot of revisions required from all of you.

1629
03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:48.259
Monal S: But, this is Control Flow 2 Advance. Advance has one more part, which I… we will do it later.

1630
03:06:49.490 --> 03:06:53.140
Monal S: Guys, Wednesday, we will have usual class. Wednesday is not doubt class.

1631
03:06:53.790 --> 03:06:56.619
Monal S: Okay, now jump to the final topic.

1632
03:06:59.050 --> 03:07:07.839
Monal S: It will… I will only introduce it, but later we will talk about how to perform coding and all. If time permits, we can also do it. Okay.

1633
03:07:08.250 --> 03:07:16.990
Monal S: So, primary data types… primary… data types, of Python.

1634
03:07:17.710 --> 03:07:23.009
Monal S: Or any languages, the base data types is called as primitive data types.

1635
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:32.479
Monal S: Primitive, data type. What are the perimity data types we have understood?

1636
03:07:32.650 --> 03:07:41.220
Monal S: Guys, tell me… We have seen integer, float, String Boolean.

1637
03:07:42.990 --> 03:07:43.950
Monal S: Okay?

1638
03:07:44.960 --> 03:08:00.429
Monal S: Now, there are data types which are made for other purpose. Here, we have seen that I have to create A equals to 2, or if I want to create ID of person 1, I will write a variable ID1, and their ID.

1639
03:08:00.740 --> 03:08:05.469
Monal S: If another ID is there, I have to create another variable, write their ID.

1640
03:08:05.730 --> 03:08:08.580
Monal S: If there are thousand such people.

1641
03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:12.350
Monal S: Dive, we need to create thousand variables, yes or no?

1642
03:08:13.050 --> 03:08:14.299
Monal S: Yes or no?

1643
03:08:15.270 --> 03:08:17.189
Monal S: So this is now an issue.

1644
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:21.649
Monal S: We require a different way to deal with the data.

1645
03:08:21.960 --> 03:08:34.679
Monal S: We cannot deal with primary data types, we require a different, complex way to deal with data. And there comes non-primitive data types. Those are not the primary data types of the language.

1646
03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:44.330
Monal S: But it helps us a lot scale our application. Scale means improve, scale, store a lot of things in an efficient way. Those are called as…

1647
03:08:44.350 --> 03:08:49.140
Monal S: None… primitive data types.

1648
03:08:51.870 --> 03:08:59.690
Monal S: Are we clear? Here in Python, in Java, we call those as array. This is about Java, but we are not learning Java.

1649
03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:05.689
Monal S: It is not similar to Java, but it is kind of similar. In Python, we have something called as list.

1650
03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:09.720
Monal S: We have something called as list.

1651
03:09:09.910 --> 03:09:12.910
Monal S: Then, dictionary DICT.

1652
03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:15.050
Monal S: Then we have tuple.

1653
03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:18.040
Monal S: Then we have set.

1654
03:09:19.010 --> 03:09:23.409
Monal S: We have more, but these are the major types which we will be using.

1655
03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:25.930
Monal S: Are we clear?

1656
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:28.720
Monal S: Guys.

1657
03:09:29.220 --> 03:09:36.159
Monal S: Dinesh, tell me what arrays is… array, are you talking about NumPy? Do we have it in Python directly, or in NumPy?

1658
03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:38.080
Monal S: Danish?

1659
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:42.940
Monal S: Danish?

1660
03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:45.090
Monal S: Can I write array?

1661
03:09:45.450 --> 03:09:47.030
Monal S: In Python directly?

1662
03:09:51.340 --> 03:09:52.789
Monal S: We don't have array.

1663
03:09:52.950 --> 03:10:00.420
Monal S: It is not native to the Python. It is native to some other library, alright? We are talking about Python here, we will understand this later.

1664
03:10:00.920 --> 03:10:05.430
Monal S: Okay? So, list. Now, I will talk about list, okay?

1665
03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:08.200
Monal S: This is how we create a list.

1666
03:10:14.210 --> 03:10:19.119
Monal S: List starts with square bracket, square bracket.

1667
03:10:22.220 --> 03:10:26.760
Monal S: A square bracket, and ends with closing square bracket.

1668
03:10:27.330 --> 03:10:31.270
Monal S: Closing… Square bracket.

1669
03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:39.809
Monal S: In between, we write values R… Values are, comma, separated.

1670
03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:52.359
Monal S: and then we provide a variable name here. We don't write list, but we write a variable name here. Simple example. Simple example.

1671
03:10:53.170 --> 03:10:54.579
Monal S: Let me write…

1672
03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.770
Monal S: more data types.

1673
03:11:03.780 --> 03:11:04.610
Monal S: Okay?

1674
03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:11.120
Monal S: Let's suppose I want to create IDs of people. So, I have created a variable name IDPeople.

1675
03:11:12.500 --> 03:11:24.149
Monal S: Sri, if primitive means the base of any language, the basic language, non-primitive means that is not directly from the language, it is made from compounding or other things, okay?

1676
03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:38.849
Monal S: ID people I have created, then here I can write 100, 101, 102, whatever I want. 103, 104, 105. I can write thousands of people ID in the same variable.

1677
03:11:39.370 --> 03:11:42.799
Monal S: Is it better than creating thousand different variables?

1678
03:11:43.700 --> 03:11:46.670
Monal S: Is it better than creating thousand different variables?

1679
03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:49.850
Monal S: Now, see how to print it.

1680
03:11:53.970 --> 03:11:56.089
Monal S: Are we able to see all of them?

1681
03:11:56.760 --> 03:11:59.390
Monal S: Are we able to see all of them? Yes.

1682
03:12:01.010 --> 03:12:03.239
Monal S: Let's go to the little depth.

1683
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:07.790
Monal S: In Java and other languages, we have array.

1684
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:12.939
Monal S: An array at a time can store only one data type.

1685
03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:17.040
Monal S: Suppose this array consists of only what kind of values?

1686
03:12:17.660 --> 03:12:20.519
Monal S: We are not talking about Python, but we are talking about other language.

1687
03:12:20.670 --> 03:12:23.400
Monal S: It consists of only integers.

1688
03:12:24.510 --> 03:12:29.050
Monal S: This array consists of… Hello?

1689
03:12:29.210 --> 03:12:30.170
Monal S: Word.

1690
03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.579
Monal S: This area is only STR.

1691
03:12:34.450 --> 03:12:39.540
Monal S: In Python, we don't have array. This is, let me write, not Python.

1692
03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:45.709
Monal S: In Python, we have a flexibility, we have a list.

1693
03:12:46.590 --> 03:12:56.230
Monal S: List can store integers, it can also store float, it can also store my name.

1694
03:12:56.800 --> 03:13:01.240
Monal S: in a single list. So these are integer, float, and string.

1695
03:13:01.530 --> 03:13:03.790
Monal S: It does not gives you an error.

1696
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:10.279
Monal S: So, lists are powerful. So, serious. Now, instead of ID people, can I write

1697
03:13:17.420 --> 03:13:27.280
Monal S: ID is 101.100102, and let's write their grade ABC, that is a string.

1698
03:13:28.690 --> 03:13:36.769
Monal S: In small b, I can also write… I can also write… Let's say, some decimal.

1699
03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:40.609
Monal S: I can also write Boolean.

1700
03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:47.480
Monal S: Is it working?

1701
03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:54.690
Monal S: Guys, in Python, a lot of the things are dynamic. Devanshi?

1702
03:13:55.210 --> 03:13:56.409
Monal S: It is dynamic.

1703
03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:00.709
Monal S: It acquires the space based on the values.

1704
03:14:02.230 --> 03:14:05.739
Monal S: Guys, there is no limit, you can fill as much values as you want.

1705
03:14:06.620 --> 03:14:08.200
Monal S: Is this part clear?

1706
03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:10.210
Monal S: Is this part clear?

1707
03:14:11.680 --> 03:14:14.019
Monal S: And guys, if I print the type.

1708
03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:23.930
Monal S: if I print the type of people, I should see what I should see what… List.

1709
03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:29.509
Monal S: And if I print, if I print using the original Pythonic way.

1710
03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:32.770
Monal S: It is a class of type list.

1711
03:14:34.620 --> 03:14:37.229
Monal S: And tell me what I'm trying to do here.

1712
03:14:40.340 --> 03:14:43.290
Monal S: Tell me, is this a function or a method?

1713
03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:48.029
Monal S: Is this a function or a method? You guys will tell me.

1714
03:14:48.980 --> 03:14:50.590
Monal S: Why it is a method?

1715
03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:53.759
Monal S: Why we are calling it as a method, or a property.

1716
03:14:54.980 --> 03:14:56.990
Monal S: Why we're calling it as a property?

1717
03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:03.909
Monal S: Because it uses dot, And it is a property or attribute of people.

1718
03:15:04.150 --> 03:15:07.860
Monal S: People is nothing but list. List is a class.

1719
03:15:08.580 --> 03:15:14.490
Monal S: Now, see what I'm doing. The original list has true at the last element.

1720
03:15:14.850 --> 03:15:16.820
Monal S: Now, let me append…

1721
03:15:19.010 --> 03:15:25.909
Monal S: Data science. See, in append bracket, I'm writing the value. It can be anything. Guys, see this? I'm telling you.

1722
03:15:26.370 --> 03:15:29.910
Monal S: Let's print the… let's print people now.

1723
03:15:32.100 --> 03:15:33.390
Monal S: What happened?

1724
03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:35.420
Monal S: Sri, what happened?

1725
03:15:39.770 --> 03:15:46.720
Monal S: It appended… it appended a new value at the end of the people list.

1726
03:15:48.130 --> 03:15:49.859
Monal S: Are we able to understand?

1727
03:15:51.140 --> 03:15:54.649
Monal S: Praveen, why do you have string in quotes? Praveen?

1728
03:15:55.600 --> 03:15:58.990
Monal S: Guys, why do we have string in quotes?

1729
03:16:01.250 --> 03:16:03.850
Monal S: Without codes, you cannot have string.

1730
03:16:07.250 --> 03:16:08.620
Monal S: Arachana, correct?

1731
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:14.090
Monal S: String is always coded, you cannot create a string without a double quote or single quote.

1732
03:16:15.690 --> 03:16:16.450
Monal S: Okay.

1733
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:19.410
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand this method?

1734
03:16:20.220 --> 03:16:21.450
Monal S: Hi, everyone!

1735
03:16:23.140 --> 03:16:33.350
Monal S: Now, let's go to more advanced version of list, then I will not teach you more. It will be enough for today's class, okay? Now, where do we use list?

1736
03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:41.560
Monal S: Let's talk about the problem statement. We can have n number of problem statements, but one of them is, I want to create

1737
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:45.240
Monal S: information, I want to create people register.

1738
03:16:47.460 --> 03:16:57.060
Monal S: It means information about people. When someone… when people register, this one is used for… you're building

1739
03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:05.129
Monal S: Entry register. When someone enters in your building, you want your security guard to enter their details.

1740
03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:09.019
Monal S: Usually, what details we will pick? What is their name?

1741
03:17:09.540 --> 03:17:13.729
Monal S: What is their phone number? What is their address?

1742
03:17:13.890 --> 03:17:16.019
Monal S: At what time they are in.

1743
03:17:16.130 --> 03:17:21.190
Monal S: As well as, at what time they are out, And what is their reason?

1744
03:17:22.110 --> 03:17:23.070
Monal S: Yes?

1745
03:17:23.650 --> 03:17:26.520
Monal S: Purpose? Yes, reason is purpose.

1746
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:27.850
Monal S: Yes, guys?

1747
03:17:28.020 --> 03:17:29.940
Monal S: And usually the flat number.

1748
03:17:30.510 --> 03:17:33.729
Monal S: So, how many variables we need? 1.

1749
03:17:34.120 --> 03:17:39.519
Monal S: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1750
03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:47.310
Monal S: So we require 7 variables here, and all of these 7 variables we require for 1 person.

1751
03:17:48.890 --> 03:17:51.220
Monal S: If I have 100%,

1752
03:17:51.380 --> 03:17:57.170
Monal S: I have to create 100 times 7, that is 700 variables, to store only 100 people.

1753
03:17:59.140 --> 03:18:00.879
Monal S: Does this sound good?

1754
03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:07.439
Monal S: As a developer, if you… if someone will ask you to write all of different variables, does this sound good?

1755
03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:09.239
Monal S: No, it does not.

1756
03:18:10.570 --> 03:18:16.859
Monal S: No, it does not. So what we can do, say this, what we can do, we can create

1757
03:18:17.570 --> 03:18:27.409
Monal S: We can take all of these variables, 1, 2, 3, I'm not writing the value, I'm just writing the numbers. 5, 6, 7, in a list.

1758
03:18:29.330 --> 03:18:31.939
Monal S: So, for single person, I will have…

1759
03:18:32.170 --> 03:18:37.530
Monal S: for single person, I will have a single variable. Yes or no?

1760
03:18:37.870 --> 03:18:39.119
Monal S: Yes or no?

1761
03:18:39.790 --> 03:18:47.000
Monal S: Yes, for a single person, I will have a single variable, which will have 7 values. Only one variable name.

1762
03:18:47.200 --> 03:18:51.270
Monal S: For hand rate, for hand rate, how many variables I have to create?

1763
03:18:51.780 --> 03:18:54.670
Monal S: For 100 people, how many variables I have to create?

1764
03:18:55.230 --> 03:18:57.569
Monal S: 100 variables in total.

1765
03:18:58.090 --> 03:18:59.030
Monal S: Yes?

1766
03:18:59.300 --> 03:19:07.170
Monal S: So, all the way from 700 to 100, we were able to reduce number of variables. Is this a better solution?

1767
03:19:07.870 --> 03:19:09.719
Monal S: Is this a better solution?

1768
03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:11.620
Monal S: Yes.

1769
03:19:11.900 --> 03:19:14.519
Monal S: We can do further optimization.

1770
03:19:14.810 --> 03:19:19.329
Monal S: What we can do, Person 1 is already a list.

1771
03:19:19.940 --> 03:19:29.330
Monal S: I can create a register, I can create a register which is already an empty list. I will tell you how to create an empty list. This is an empty list.

1772
03:19:30.190 --> 03:19:37.900
Monal S: Why not I can use register, dot append To append person.

1773
03:19:42.190 --> 03:19:46.310
Monal S: Append uses what? Value. Person 1 is a value or not?

1774
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:48.740
Monal S: Person 1 is a value or not.

1775
03:19:49.090 --> 03:19:51.200
Monal S: Person 1 is also a value.

1776
03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:54.820
Monal S: How many var- how many variables I need now?

1777
03:19:55.860 --> 03:19:57.900
Monal S: How many variables I need now?

1778
03:19:58.400 --> 03:19:59.130
Monal S: Run.

1779
03:20:00.370 --> 03:20:02.030
Monal S: Now see this in action.

1780
03:20:03.250 --> 03:20:08.860
Monal S: let's create… I'm not going to create those 7 variables, but I will create… Let's say, name.

1781
03:20:09.170 --> 03:20:14.969
Monal S: Okay, I will create name, So, first, let's create the register.

1782
03:20:15.620 --> 03:20:19.190
Monal S: Register is empty, but empty is also a list, yes or no?

1783
03:20:19.350 --> 03:20:23.850
Monal S: Just like, similarly, we can have name as empty string.

1784
03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:32.150
Monal S: if I print name, it is still, it is empty, but it is still… But it is still…

1785
03:20:32.590 --> 03:20:33.800
Monal S: a string.

1786
03:20:34.350 --> 03:20:35.350
Monal S: print.

1787
03:20:37.200 --> 03:20:38.769
Monal S: Type of name.

1788
03:20:39.300 --> 03:20:40.240
Monal S: Yes?

1789
03:20:40.530 --> 03:20:44.919
Monal S: It is empty, but it is still a string. Is everyone clear with this concept?

1790
03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:54.910
Monal S: Is everyone clear with this concept? Similarly, I'm going to comment it. This is for our own use case, okay? It will make our notes bad.

1791
03:20:55.090 --> 03:21:04.269
Monal S: So, I've created a register which is empty, and if you want to print the type of register, you will see class list. This is done.

1792
03:21:04.680 --> 03:21:10.490
Monal S: Now, what we will do? Register.append. What we require? We require value.

1793
03:21:11.410 --> 03:21:13.510
Monal S: Can I write something like this?

1794
03:21:15.360 --> 03:21:21.730
Monal S: Let's say flat number 101, my phone number 101 is, integer.

1795
03:21:22.640 --> 03:21:30.350
Monal S: my phone number is not an integer, because I want to add that Extension. Not extension.

1796
03:21:30.780 --> 03:21:42.490
Monal S: So, I will write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. We cannot write this in integer plus 91, okay? Then, let's write the reason. We will just write visit.

1797
03:21:43.870 --> 03:21:45.219
Monal S: Is this fine?

1798
03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:47.789
Monal S: Is this fine, guys?

1799
03:21:49.390 --> 03:21:58.190
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand? This is nothing but a value. Either I can write it like this, or I can create a variable

1800
03:21:58.460 --> 03:22:02.180
Monal S: And pass the variable inside append, both of them are same.

1801
03:22:03.480 --> 03:22:05.690
Monal S: Both of them are same, yes or no.

1802
03:22:06.360 --> 03:22:10.820
Monal S: But here we are only using one variable, and below we are using two.

1803
03:22:10.960 --> 03:22:15.769
Monal S: Guys, tell me first whether you are able to understand that both of the codes are doing the same thing.

1804
03:22:17.730 --> 03:22:21.149
Monal S: I want everyone to say yes, no, very simple.

1805
03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:29.070
Monal S: List inside a list? Yes.

1806
03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:40.710
Monal S: So what I'm going to do, I am commenting this so that you guys can see, what we are doing. So, register.append, we are appending a list itself.

1807
03:22:41.060 --> 03:22:45.839
Monal S: Done. Code is done. Now let's print the register and see what it is doing.

1808
03:22:49.530 --> 03:22:56.289
Monal S: There is that empty list. Inside that, we have the new value. This whole thing is a new value.

1809
03:22:58.140 --> 03:23:03.470
Monal S: Now, what I will do… Now, I will write Pradeep Snake.

1810
03:23:04.080 --> 03:23:05.070
Monal S: Pradeep.

1811
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:09.929
Monal S: Okay, I saw your name, Pradeep, and I've written it.

1812
03:23:10.100 --> 03:23:16.489
Monal S: I am running again. What will happen? We are asking to append again another value in the register.

1813
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:19.310
Monal S: If I print the register, what will happen?

1814
03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:26.680
Monal S: Mona is the first one, this value is the first one. Now, inside it, we have second.

1815
03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:32.159
Monal S: Are we clear?

1816
03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:35.180
Monal S: Are we clear?

1817
03:23:36.300 --> 03:23:43.730
Monal S: Now, someone is asking that, why do we have two brackets? It is a visualization thing that you need to understand. See this?

1818
03:23:43.890 --> 03:23:49.719
Monal S: Everyone who thinks, why in real time it won't happen, it will happen. Guys, in real time it happens.

1819
03:23:52.250 --> 03:23:54.429
Monal S: This is our original register.

1820
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:58.539
Monal S: This is the value which we are appending.

1821
03:23:59.690 --> 03:24:05.800
Monal S: Here, it already have a bracket. This one is our register, which already has a bracket. These…

1822
03:24:05.900 --> 03:24:09.419
Monal S: This is different from this one. How many of you agree?

1823
03:24:10.610 --> 03:24:14.589
Monal S: This value is different, this value is different. Yes.

1824
03:24:15.170 --> 03:24:17.779
Monal S: If I add this value here.

1825
03:24:19.540 --> 03:24:21.900
Monal S: It will look like this, yes or no?

1826
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:24.850
Monal S: Yes or no?

1827
03:24:24.970 --> 03:24:29.510
Monal S: This whole thing is one value. We are inserting one value.

1828
03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:34.649
Monal S: If I insert another value, 1, 4, 5, 6,

1829
03:24:35.450 --> 03:24:43.620
Monal S: In this list, which already has a value, what will happen? This is the first value, 1, 2, 3, 4. We are appending a new.

1830
03:24:43.820 --> 03:24:49.249
Monal S: New means comma separated, because we need a… we need a differentiating factor.

1831
03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:51.970
Monal S: 1, 4, 5, 6.

1832
03:24:52.500 --> 03:24:55.009
Monal S: This is one value, see this?

1833
03:24:55.160 --> 03:25:02.079
Monal S: This is one value, this is another value, and the white one is the original register, this one.

1834
03:25:04.010 --> 03:25:07.500
Monal S: Between that, we have these values. Are we clear?

1835
03:25:08.470 --> 03:25:10.149
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

1836
03:25:13.280 --> 03:25:20.139
Monal S: And guys, List does not care if the first one has 4, second one has 10.

1837
03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:24.829
Monal S: For list, It is nothing but a value.

1838
03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:30.850
Monal S: Let me show you multiple… We are just doing experimentation on lists.

1839
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:34.830
Monal S: Say this.

1840
03:25:37.970 --> 03:25:40.790
Monal S: Let's create… I'm calling this list as dummy.

1841
03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:42.190
Monal S: This is dummy.

1842
03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:43.930
Monal S: Dummy's empty.

1843
03:25:44.380 --> 03:25:49.679
Monal S: Now what I'm doing, I'm using dummy.append to add the value, I added 0.

1844
03:25:50.470 --> 03:25:55.550
Monal S: And here, I will keep on printing the same cell, because I don't want to write a lot of print.

1845
03:25:55.930 --> 03:25:57.500
Monal S: Does this look good?

1846
03:25:57.650 --> 03:26:00.260
Monal S: Guys, is this looking good?

1847
03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:02.520
Monal S: Okay.

1848
03:26:02.620 --> 03:26:06.530
Monal S: Now, what I will do, if I run this same cell, what will happen, guys?

1849
03:26:06.680 --> 03:26:11.759
Monal S: If I run this same block, what will happen? If I run the same block, what will happen?

1850
03:26:13.690 --> 03:26:20.289
Monal S: 0 get added again. So if I print dummy again, Is this correct?

1851
03:26:20.610 --> 03:26:25.969
Monal S: Is this correct? So, how many times I will use append value gets added.

1852
03:26:26.230 --> 03:26:30.000
Monal S: Now, instead of 0, I will add hello.

1853
03:26:32.470 --> 03:26:33.730
Monal S: looks correct.

1854
03:26:35.290 --> 03:26:40.650
Monal S: Append does not care what happens in between, it only requires value.

1855
03:26:40.770 --> 03:26:42.420
Monal S: This is also a value.

1856
03:26:43.900 --> 03:26:48.320
Monal S: This whole thing is also a value. If I run again, what you will see?

1857
03:26:50.240 --> 03:26:52.099
Monal S: This whole thing is a value.

1858
03:26:54.130 --> 03:26:56.100
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand?

1859
03:26:56.520 --> 03:26:57.730
Monal S: Everyone.

1860
03:26:58.640 --> 03:27:08.629
Monal S: Again, I want to add new. Now, this list has, again, hello, my name, And my flat number.

1861
03:27:10.140 --> 03:27:15.600
Monal S: This is a new value. What list will do the new… what list will do to the new value?

1862
03:27:16.890 --> 03:27:19.940
Monal S: It will again do its job, append it.

1863
03:27:20.500 --> 03:27:24.359
Monal S: If I print it, I will see a new value separated by comma series.

1864
03:27:24.660 --> 03:27:33.610
Monal S: Comma inside a list is different, but if you see from the main high level, from the first level, it is separated by its own comma.

1865
03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:38.820
Monal S: Are we clear?

1866
03:27:39.500 --> 03:27:40.909
Monal S: Are we clear?

1867
03:27:42.410 --> 03:27:45.760
Monal S: Now, I will show you one function. See this?

1868
03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:49.480
Monal S: Function is called as len, L-E-N.

1869
03:27:49.720 --> 03:28:00.550
Monal S: In this function, if we provide any class where we have multiple values, I will talk about it in the next class, it is called as iterables. If I provide dummy, guys, what is dummy?

1870
03:28:00.940 --> 03:28:03.869
Monal S: What is dummy? Agrawal, next class.

1871
03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:05.659
Monal S: Dummy is a list.

1872
03:28:06.450 --> 03:28:07.799
Monal S: What is 5?

1873
03:28:08.580 --> 03:28:18.570
Monal S: 5 is number of elements. Let's count element 1, element 2, element 3, Element 4… Element 5.

1874
03:28:18.760 --> 03:28:20.119
Monal S: Is this correct?

1875
03:28:21.730 --> 03:28:23.999
Monal S: Encore int is not list is retriever.

1876
03:28:27.070 --> 03:28:28.630
Monal S: Ravi Kair is not there.

1877
03:28:31.900 --> 03:28:33.490
Monal S: Is everyone clear?

1878
03:28:34.540 --> 03:28:48.179
Monal S: So guys, there are lots of things. Primitive data types is the base of your coding. It will take time, but in today's class, I just want you to introduce on the powerful data types which we require.

1879
03:28:48.580 --> 03:28:53.480
Monal S: Which we cannot do with simple primitive data types, but it is made from

1880
03:28:53.580 --> 03:28:57.470
Monal S: All of these are nothing but primitive only, yes or no. Guys?

1881
03:28:57.680 --> 03:29:06.040
Monal S: All of this are nothing but primitives only. Combinations of primitives create non-primitives in Python. So, guys.

1882
03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:10.979
Monal S: Am I using length from list, or length on list?

1883
03:29:13.190 --> 03:29:15.739
Monal S: Say this, this is a function.

1884
03:29:18.020 --> 03:29:24.569
Monal S: But append is… Append is a method of list.

1885
03:29:26.260 --> 03:29:28.049
Monal S: Append is a method of list.

1886
03:29:30.670 --> 03:29:33.050
Monal S: So, make sure that you write this in notes.

1887
03:29:33.420 --> 03:29:40.459
Monal S: Alright? And this completes our today's class, and I hope everyone is happy with today's class. Guys.

1888
03:29:41.400 --> 03:29:43.519
Monal S: All of you are happy with today's class?

1889
03:29:44.670 --> 03:29:45.620
Monal S: Yes?

1890
03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:50.170
Monal S: So, what is your job, guys? What is your assignment, again?

1891
03:29:50.410 --> 03:29:57.549
Monal S: Because we are in the beginner level, I want all of you to revise each and everything as much as you can.

1892
03:29:57.710 --> 03:30:00.639
Monal S: The more you revise, the more you understand.

1893
03:30:02.080 --> 03:30:12.340
Monal S: So again, it is a poll time. In the meantime, let me zip all of this content so that I can paste it in the community. Guys, task I will give you from the next class, Wednesday's class.

1894
03:30:12.690 --> 03:30:13.640
Monal S: Alright?

1895
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:18.350
Monal S: And personally, guys, the way I'm teaching this slow, I hope

1896
03:30:18.720 --> 03:30:28.079
Monal S: C-sharp means both. Gaurav, in C-sharp auto, it is different. Property… Gaurav, if you understand C-sharp, property is a part of class. Property is not a part of normal code.

1897
03:30:28.370 --> 03:30:33.819
Monal S: Property is nothing but method. It is just an interchangeable name. I will talk… I will teach you that in oops.

1898
03:30:38.040 --> 03:30:44.370
Monal S: Okay, so let me save everything, save today's notes as well.

1899
03:30:47.020 --> 03:30:52.919
Monal S: And guys, the slow I'm teaching, I am thinking that none of… very less of you is going to have doubt.

1900
03:30:57.540 --> 03:30:59.930
Monal S: 2026 notes.

1901
03:31:06.260 --> 03:31:17.599
Monal S: Guys, right now, I will not suggest you to do practice. If you forget your foundation… if you forget your foundation and work on just coding, you will not understand. Revise each and everything what I'm teaching.

1902
03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:25.089
Monal S: Guys, give me a second. I'm not able… I'm not currently seeing your chats. I'm focusing on providing you notes.

1903
03:31:32.250 --> 03:31:33.050
Monal S: Right?

1904
03:31:36.970 --> 03:31:38.439
Monal S: Press to zip…

1905
03:31:54.720 --> 03:31:56.350
Monal S: This is data science.

1906
03:31:57.080 --> 03:32:05.969
Monal S: our badge, and zip is there. And guys, I really like that you guys are also helping other people in the community, and this is what I want.

1907
03:32:06.260 --> 03:32:15.569
Monal S: I will jump in whenever I can, and whenever you guys are not able to solve it, I do that, but in the meantime, if other people are able to help, that is,

1908
03:32:15.960 --> 03:32:18.780
Monal S: That is more than required, and thank you very much for that.

1909
03:32:20.520 --> 03:32:25.720
Monal S: Guys, notes I have appended in the community, I will also send in our chat here.

1910
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:33.050
Monal S: I mean, guys, I will talk about there are a lot of different methods which we are going to do for the list. For now.

1911
03:32:33.220 --> 03:32:34.800
Monal S: We will not do that.

1912
03:32:35.470 --> 03:32:36.440
Monal S: Okay?

1913
03:32:37.470 --> 03:32:41.220
Monal S: to later class. We will learn all of that in next class.

1914
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:49.530
Monal S: Practical, Level 1… Lectures, 18 and 18.

1915
03:32:49.650 --> 03:32:52.400
Monal S: I've also sent that in our…

1916
03:32:56.240 --> 03:32:59.560
Monal S: in our, Zoom chat, so you guys can also check it.

1917
03:33:00.260 --> 03:33:04.719
Monal S: There are, again, people who is giving me 1-2-star feedback, I'm not sure.

1918
03:33:05.420 --> 03:33:12.370
Monal S: I will suggest them to have course from Scalar and other companies, then they will know what is going on in the market.

1919
03:33:20.800 --> 03:33:30.209
Monal S: Guys, next class will be more on the data types, and we will also go into the loops part. Loop is very important. Without loops, you cannot do much of a coding.

1920
03:33:30.350 --> 03:33:34.349
Monal S: Guys, color theme, I am using, I think, Cyberpunk. You guys can check it.

1921
03:33:34.800 --> 03:33:40.149
Monal S: Which headphones I use? Guys, this is Sony WX000MX5.

1922
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:46.090
Monal S: Thank you very much, Vishnu. Thank you, guys.

1923
03:33:46.710 --> 03:33:48.590
Monal S: Accident class date, guys.

1924
03:33:48.900 --> 03:34:07.440
Monal S: Only if you have doubt regarding today's class, then let's do it, because once you jump to the more complex part, then it is good for you to advise which path to spread. Right now, if you go to any other path, you will fail. If you don't want to fail, stay in this path until you get some… your grounds clear.

1925
03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:08.550
Monal S: Okay?

1926
03:34:09.410 --> 03:34:22.439
Monal S: Guys, Bitwise is not for us as a data scientist. It might be used for some other program who is creating electronics, they want to create a simulator or something, but for now, you… guys, I've shared the code as well, it is present in the zip.

1927
03:34:24.700 --> 03:34:28.719
Monal S: Naman, if you want to do that, do it. Why you want to do that, Naman?

1928
03:34:29.560 --> 03:34:34.489
Monal S: Print dummy is greater than zero. What is the use of, print? Naman, tell me.

1929
03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:38.910
Monal S: Naman, tell me what is the use of print.

1930
03:34:42.890 --> 03:34:47.370
Monal S: If you guys will ask me some other question, now I will cross-question your base, which I've taught.

1931
03:34:49.320 --> 03:34:55.340
Monal S: Assignments, guys, the today assignment is revise as much as you can. Assignments will be from next class.

1932
03:34:56.440 --> 03:35:01.880
Monal S: Guys, yesterday class is also… yesterday file is also present, I have downloaded it yesterday night.

1933
03:35:03.140 --> 03:35:08.499
Monal S: yesterday class. Guys, whoever does not have doubt, you can leave, and whoever is having doubt.

1934
03:35:08.960 --> 03:35:20.700
Monal S: I know a lot of people will not have doubt, and guys, happy Sunday, thanks for attending. It's a great weekend to teach you guys, and this is the first week which we have completed, and we'll see you next Wednesday, alright?

1935
03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:22.649
Monal S: Thank you, guys, thank you very much.

1936
03:35:22.770 --> 03:35:34.530
Monal S: Wednesday class is 2 hours, and there we will not have doubt session, as I mentioned, because we don't have time for doubt. So it will be a light topic, in-depth, but doubts part will be clear on Friday.

1937
03:35:34.860 --> 03:35:42.030
Monal S: Thank you very much, guys, thank you. And don't forget to create LinkedIn posts, because you get more clarity there.

1938
03:35:42.630 --> 03:36:02.429
Monal S: If you tag me and Chris, sir, we also comment, we also like on that comment. Again, it's the way you write your post. In that way, you will also learn to create posts, so if you do that, it will be more than enough for you, because when you're going for job hunting and others, people will be able to see, yes? Whoever has doubt, please raise your hand.

1939
03:36:02.540 --> 03:36:04.240
Monal S: I will start with Shiva.

1940
03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:07.119
Monal S: Shiva? Yes, thank you very much, guys.

1941
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:08.890
Monal S: Hey, Shiva.

1942
03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:13.209
Siva Subramanian: Hi, Monal. It's a great question, Monal.

1943
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:23.630
Siva Subramanian: Thank you for the question. I have one doubt, regarding that, reviewing the courses. So, I, I just want, saw that, Ultimate Data Sciences are GenA Last Year courses also.

1944
03:36:23.660 --> 03:36:24.510
Monal S: Cool.

1945
03:36:25.070 --> 03:36:32.290
Siva Subramanian: So that also, it's around more than 2 to 4 hours. And these courses, I have downloaded all the courses.

1946
03:36:32.580 --> 03:36:42.249
Siva Subramanian: But, pre-request courses, like, YouTube, like, Krishna, like, have attached this, YouTube prerequest code, like, Python.

1947
03:36:42.250 --> 03:36:55.120
Monal S: prerequisite, it's not a prerequisite. It's a way, if you want to fast-track your learning, you can watch those. It's not a prerequisite. Prerequisite I'm teaching, I'm teaching you from the memory itself. What is a computer? You will not get it on the YouTube.

1948
03:36:55.680 --> 03:37:04.079
Siva Subramanian: Yeah, yes, yes, your course is also there, I downloaded. But what the thing is, I don't know how to manage and review back and back, so it's a long time.

1949
03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:06.850
Monal S: you have to do? See, you're attending live sessions, right?

1950
03:37:06.850 --> 03:37:07.570
Siva Subramanian: Yeah.

1951
03:37:07.710 --> 03:37:12.609
Monal S: Batch for recording is for people who want to watch it in a faster pace.

1952
03:37:12.960 --> 03:37:14.020
Siva Subramanian: Alright.

1953
03:37:14.020 --> 03:37:18.789
Monal S: This version is if you want to start from scratch and don't want to watch the batchman recording.

1954
03:37:19.080 --> 03:37:23.540
Monal S: That's all. Why you're watching Batch 1 and Batch 2, it is a lot of works, you know.

1955
03:37:24.130 --> 03:37:33.740
Monal S: Either watch batch one and complete that path, because that is already an ongoing course, or stay here if you want, if you like live sessions, if you want to… because that is also taught by me, right?

1956
03:37:33.940 --> 03:37:34.450
Siva Subramanian: Yeah.

1957
03:37:34.450 --> 03:37:39.670
Monal S: So you can go… why do you want to focus on both ways? That is an additional option that you have.

1958
03:37:41.080 --> 03:37:52.219
Siva Subramanian: So, yeah, yes, yes, clear. So, this five courses which you have completed, like, basics, so I, I can watch, one time and, taking notes.

1959
03:37:52.220 --> 03:37:53.840
Monal S: Yes, yes, yes, that's all.

1960
03:37:54.050 --> 03:37:54.550
Monal S: All right.

1961
03:37:55.050 --> 03:37:58.569
Siva Subramanian: Yeah, yes, yes, clear, water, yeah, clear product, that's it.

1962
03:38:00.370 --> 03:38:04.689
Monal S: Alright, then we have Avni. Avni?

1963
03:38:05.840 --> 03:38:10.719
Monal S: Guys, no need to watch patch 1. It is only if you want to watch it and fast track your learning.

1964
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:13.840
Monal S: But if you want to go in this page, it is cool.

1965
03:38:14.110 --> 03:38:16.250
Monal S: Monal, S5.

1966
03:38:16.610 --> 03:38:26.459
Monal S: Satya, according to your code, I will get, good, because 5 is greater than 5, it is false. I will go into…

1967
03:38:26.750 --> 03:38:28.240
Monal S: 5 is greater than 4.

1968
03:38:28.430 --> 03:38:32.679
Monal S: That is a good… But yeah, I understood, Satya. Yes, Avni, tell me.

1969
03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:38.499
Avni Yadav: Colonel, can you hear me?

1970
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:39.629
Monal S: Yes, yes, I can.

1971
03:38:40.660 --> 03:38:46.020
Avni Yadav: Borilla, I have a question. Sorry, my name is coming as an incorrect one here. That's fine.

1972
03:38:46.120 --> 03:38:56.670
Avni Yadav: Question regarding the 17th January that you showed as the Jupyter file. I'm still not able to select the kernel there.

1973
03:38:57.230 --> 03:39:01.930
Monal S: Have you tried the solution which other people are using? I sh… I… Okay.

1974
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.849
Monal S: Did you try.

1975
03:39:02.850 --> 03:39:08.800
Avni Yadav: Yeah, I tried… yeah, I tried few of those things, that, people have it online.

1976
03:39:09.230 --> 03:39:10.420
Monal S: Alright, okay.

1977
03:39:15.070 --> 03:39:20.109
Monal S: Can you share your screen? I'm converting you to panelists. Let's see what you're doing.

1978
03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:21.250
Avni Yadav: Cool.

1979
03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:36.349
Avni Yadav: I'm just trying to share my screen.

1980
03:39:40.470 --> 03:39:43.980
Monal S: The next pen tab, which I'm using is from Huan.

1981
03:39:44.300 --> 03:39:47.949
Monal S: And it is a very old one, I think this one is also already…

1982
03:39:48.280 --> 03:39:50.930
Monal S: Deprecated, they are not using it.

1983
03:39:52.370 --> 03:39:56.909
Monal S: The speaker, I'm not saying I only use headphones, this is Sony's headphone.

1984
03:39:57.640 --> 03:40:05.089
Monal S: Guys, as a data scientist, you don't require DSA, but as a software engineer, you require it. Alright, can you select kernel? Click on select kernel.

1985
03:40:05.090 --> 03:40:13.769
Avni Yadav: Yeah, so, kernel, I'm trying to say, select kernel, and I'm trying to look for level 1, level 1-ENV,

1986
03:40:15.310 --> 03:40:17.590
Avni Yadav: But I don't see… see that…

1987
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:19.460
Monal S: We were able to see. That is the first one.

1988
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:23.270
Monal S: There is a bigger star on that, yes.

1989
03:40:24.310 --> 03:40:28.530
Avni Yadav: Okay, it just came down. I restarted my, like… Yeah, sometimes you…

1990
03:40:28.530 --> 03:40:32.550
Monal S: You need to restart because it does not get populated. It's totally fine, I understand.

1991
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:39.350
Avni Yadav: Thank you so much. Yeah, it's working fine, and thank you so much, like, really enjoying this class, so…

1992
03:40:39.350 --> 03:40:40.590
Monal S: Thank you very much, thank you.

1993
03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:41.120
Avni Yadav: Yes.

1994
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:44.540
Avni Yadav: Hmm.

1995
03:40:44.540 --> 03:40:47.480
Monal S: Guys, your feedback really helps me a lot.

1996
03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:51.970
Monal S: Okay.

1997
03:40:52.280 --> 03:40:53.590
Monal S: Devakar?

1998
03:40:54.420 --> 03:41:00.950
Monal S: Guys, my system configuration, my system configuration, I will tell you. Okay, just a second. Sorry for that.

1999
03:41:01.180 --> 03:41:13.809
Monal S: My system configuration is… I am using AMD Ryzen 9 7900X 12-core processor. I have 32GB of RAM. I am using NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super.

2000
03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:16.890
Monal S: And I also have NVIDIA inbuilt RAID and graphics card.

2001
03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:20.909
Monal S: So, this is my system compilation. Yes, debacle.

2002
03:41:21.690 --> 03:41:31.699
Diwakar IB: Yeah, two questions, Monol. So, first one is the intendation, whatever you told, it was giving in IPYNB, right? Will the same work for .py as well?

2003
03:41:31.920 --> 03:41:34.030
Monal S: It will work if you have installed Python.

2004
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:36.290
Diwakar IB: Oh, okay.

2005
03:41:36.290 --> 03:41:38.869
Monal S: extension, right? It would work. We just could handle it, yes.

2006
03:41:39.250 --> 03:41:52.130
Diwakar IB: Okay, the second one is, the dummy, the experimentation list you shared, right? So the dummy, initially it was given at the null, right? And you gave print dummy and dummy.upund.

2007
03:41:52.330 --> 03:41:59.690
Diwakar IB: You open the normal brackets, and in that, you have given the… Square brackets, right?

2008
03:41:59.940 --> 03:42:00.630
Diwakar IB: So…

2009
03:42:00.630 --> 03:42:20.619
Monal S: Square bracket is a part of list. Normal bracket is just a part of your function's brackets. We will understand that later, but it is not a part of list. You can see, this is a bracket of append function, append method. Are you able to see? If I remove the list part from it, you will be left with append, just like a function, it looks… method looks, right?

2010
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:23.380
Monal S: Format of the Apunished function. Yes, yes, yes.

2011
03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:26.019
Monal S: And between, you have that square bracket.

2012
03:42:26.380 --> 03:42:26.930
Diwakar IB: Okay.

2013
03:42:27.610 --> 03:42:28.810
Diwakar IB: Okay, thank you.

2014
03:42:28.810 --> 03:42:30.339
Monal S: Oh, alright, thank you.

2015
03:42:31.130 --> 03:42:36.979
Monal S: Alright, next one is… Nathan? Nathan Krishna?

2016
03:42:37.900 --> 03:42:40.790
Monal S: Because I don't use laptop. I was using laptop, but.

2017
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:47.390
Nitin Krishna: Hi, hello, I don't… to put my doubts, like, do we have… where do we put the doubts?

2018
03:42:47.390 --> 03:42:48.309
Monal S: chat itself.

2019
03:42:48.310 --> 03:42:49.600
Nitin Krishna: It's webinar chat?

2020
03:42:49.850 --> 03:42:51.329
Monal S: Webinar chat, webinar chat.

2021
03:42:52.050 --> 03:42:55.009
Nitin Krishna: Okay. Or any other, like, WhatsApp, like, I don't know, like.

2022
03:42:55.010 --> 03:42:55.820
Monal S: No, no, okay.

2023
03:42:55.820 --> 03:42:58.379
Nitin Krishna: Where I missed it, I don't know.

2024
03:42:58.680 --> 03:43:00.740
Monal S: Or is it like the, where are you trying?

2025
03:43:00.740 --> 03:43:09.599
Nitin Krishna: I'm putting it here, where I've just put, hi, I have a doubt here, where you have shared in that, like, Zoom webinar, there I have put

2026
03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:18.370
Nitin Krishna: And also, I have to put it in that, the KISSNAC, web page there also, how it is, like, so, where I have to put it, so just…

2027
03:43:18.980 --> 03:43:19.689
Monal S: do this.

2028
03:43:22.530 --> 03:43:23.440
Nitin Krishna: I didn't get you.

2029
03:43:23.640 --> 03:43:28.669
Monal S: There are different kinds of questions that we use, alright? Are you able to see this screen?

2030
03:43:30.540 --> 03:43:32.299
Monal S: Yes. Are you able to say community?

2031
03:43:32.530 --> 03:43:33.280
Nitin Krishna: Yes.

2032
03:43:33.280 --> 03:43:43.539
Monal S: This is where we put questions. If you have questions after the class is over, you have some doubts, other people will help you. This is community. Is this part clear?

2033
03:43:43.570 --> 03:43:54.509
Monal S: This is where you put questions. When you have some doubt, other people will help you. I will jump it if other people will not be able to help you. Thank you very much, Momo. Is this part here? This is not for live session.

2034
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:59.899
Monal S: Okay. Are you able to see this, chat section on my screen?

2035
03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:02.500
Nitin Krishna: Nope.

2036
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:07.209
Monal S: I think this is because it is a part of Zoom, okay? It will not be able to show you.

2037
03:44:07.330 --> 03:44:14.429
Monal S: Alright, so, in Zoom, you will be able… you will see an option called as Chat, yes?

2038
03:44:14.430 --> 03:44:16.120
Nitin Krishna: Yeah, webinar chat, right?

2039
03:44:16.120 --> 03:44:20.400
Monal S: Can you please say hi? Can you please say hi there? Let's see whether your hi is coming or not.

2040
03:44:20.500 --> 03:44:21.520
Nitin Krishna: Yes, just now.

2041
03:44:21.520 --> 03:44:23.999
Monal S: Yes, I have… I am able to see your eye.

2042
03:44:24.250 --> 03:44:38.670
Monal S: Me, personally, I see your chat here, alright? And I might miss your chat because in a single second, there are a lot of people who are saying their questions or something, right? So your chat might be on top.

2043
03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:53.349
Monal S: Alright? And I might miss it. So, if you have doubt again, maybe you can copy and paste your query and then paste it again. Or, at the end, this… there are two channels. The last channel is, at the end of every doubt session, we raise the hand and then ask our query.

2044
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:56.199
Monal S: That's the other 3 channels, alright?

2045
03:44:56.200 --> 03:44:57.009
Nitin Krishna: Yeah, understood.

2046
03:44:57.180 --> 03:44:57.720
Monal S: Yep.

2047
03:44:57.960 --> 03:44:58.669
Monal S: Thanks, Evan.

2048
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:59.949
Nitin Krishna: Thank you so much, Late.

2049
03:45:00.850 --> 03:45:01.630
Monal S: You too.

2050
03:45:02.230 --> 03:45:04.879
Monal S: All right, Prince, we are next.

2051
03:45:05.050 --> 03:45:07.010
Monal S: Okay, Ananta, you will be next.

2052
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:14.739
Monal S: Guys, don't put your Q&A section, because it is hard for me to look at chat, look at community, look at Q&A, it will be all over the place. Only chat.

2053
03:45:14.740 --> 03:45:17.249
Priince: I have not put anything in GoNet, sorry.

2054
03:45:17.250 --> 03:45:20.669
Monal S: No, no, no, no, I'm talking about other people on the chat, sorry. Sorry, guys.

2055
03:45:20.670 --> 03:45:31.549
Priince: Yes, so yesterday we have created, the lecture folder, right, in VS Code. And then, in that lecture folder, we have, created virtual environment. So, every time.

2056
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:32.900
Monal S: Not inside lecture.

2057
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:37.380
Monal S: Wait, yes, inside lecture, yes, inside lecture.

2058
03:45:37.380 --> 03:45:45.260
Priince: So, every time we create another folder in Level 1 or in Level 2 in future, so we have to, create this virtual environment, right?

2059
03:45:46.920 --> 03:45:54.120
Monal S: No, a virtual environment, just like I create… see, yesterday I created a folder. Today, also, I created a folder, yes.

2060
03:45:54.770 --> 03:45:58.599
Priince: Yes, but that was under the, this head lectures.

2061
03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:10.430
Monal S: Yes. So, this is the way I am telling you, you can use this virtual environment in lectures, in… if you create another folder, let's say I'm creating a folder called as XYZ,

2062
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:11.550
Monal S: Okay?

2063
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:15.900
Monal S: In XYZ, I'm creating a notebook called as A.IPYNB.

2064
03:46:16.470 --> 03:46:21.289
Monal S: If I select a kernel, am I still able to see level 1 ENV, which is present here?

2065
03:46:21.570 --> 03:46:22.320
Priince: Yes.

2066
03:46:22.320 --> 03:46:25.910
Monal S: Do I need to clear it again? When we come out of level 1.

2067
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:33.139
Priince: Yes. We are there in Level 2 and Level 3. So, for that, different levels, we have to create, we have to create these virtual environments.

2068
03:46:33.140 --> 03:46:42.029
Monal S: We will create it, that's why we are doing it, because if we require more advanced libraries, then we will jump to level 2. This is for maintaining, but when you create a project.

2069
03:46:42.250 --> 03:46:48.960
Monal S: Okay, I will tell you how do we… when we work in the real-world industry, what we do… let me go to the very end…

2070
03:46:49.900 --> 03:46:56.759
Monal S: In real world, in project, You are working on… on, let's suppose, ML project.

2071
03:46:56.890 --> 03:46:57.750
Monal S: Okay?

2072
03:46:58.560 --> 03:47:01.570
Monal S: You will start writing your code inside this folder.

2073
03:47:02.160 --> 03:47:07.010
Monal S: And inside this folder only, you create your VNV. You don't create outside.

2074
03:47:08.230 --> 03:47:10.270
Priince: Okay. That's all. This project is over.

2075
03:47:10.350 --> 03:47:23.070
Monal S: Another project, you create its own VNV. So, I just want all of you to have this practice of creating VNV for different projects. Right now, our project… think of our project as, like, Level 1 is our project.

2076
03:47:24.150 --> 03:47:24.729
Priince: Okay, got it.

2077
03:47:24.730 --> 03:47:25.500
Monal S: Got it.

2078
03:47:25.500 --> 03:47:28.350
Priince: And this is to maintain the different versions, right?

2079
03:47:28.350 --> 03:47:31.790
Monal S: to maintain different versions? Yes, they should maintain different versions.

2080
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:33.239
Priince: Okay, okay, thank you.

2081
03:47:33.240 --> 03:47:34.390
Monal S: Yep, yes, you're welcome.

2082
03:47:35.120 --> 03:47:36.040
Monal S: That's great.

2083
03:47:36.230 --> 03:47:39.270
Monal S: Guys, I've already shared the zip in the community, please check it.

2084
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:40.980
Monal S: I've already shared.

2085
03:47:42.420 --> 03:47:47.270
Monal S: others, please help people, if you can. Then we have Ananta, where we have an anthar.

2086
03:47:47.820 --> 03:47:52.499
Monal S: Guys, if you have similar questions, please unraise your hand. Ananda Lakshmi, you're next.

2087
03:47:54.390 --> 03:48:13.150
anantha lakshmi: Yeah, hi, Mona, this, very amazing… yeah, hello. I have, like, the same question, like, the previous person asked. So, suppose in the ML project, if we have too many levels, like level 1, level 2, level 3 in one project, can we install virtual…

2088
03:48:13.330 --> 03:48:14.210
anantha lakshmi: Can we…

2089
03:48:14.210 --> 03:48:15.690
Monal S: People have never seen a single project.

2090
03:48:16.100 --> 03:48:16.640
Monal S: Lovely.

2091
03:48:17.060 --> 03:48:25.290
Monal S: I am telling you so that because we are… we are learning. Learning has different levels. A project does not have level, a project has files.

2092
03:48:25.780 --> 03:48:26.260
anantha lakshmi: Oh.

2093
03:48:26.260 --> 03:48:26.930
Monal S: Is that clear?

2094
03:48:26.930 --> 03:48:33.189
anantha lakshmi: Oh, so for the one project, one time, we can install virtual environment, right? Yes, that's up there.

2095
03:48:33.190 --> 03:48:33.720
Monal S: Excellent.

2096
03:48:34.180 --> 03:48:35.190
anantha lakshmi: Thank you.

2097
03:48:35.270 --> 03:48:36.370
Monal S: Yep, thank you.

2098
03:48:37.620 --> 03:48:39.639
Monal S: Alright, and then we have Praveen.

2099
03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:44.529
Monal S: Pavin? Hey, Pavin.

2100
03:48:44.530 --> 03:48:45.920
Praveen Girotra: Thank you, Monuv.

2101
03:48:46.170 --> 03:48:47.350
Praveen Girotra: Academy.

2102
03:48:47.350 --> 03:48:47.840
Monal S: Yes.

2103
03:48:47.840 --> 03:49:05.249
Praveen Girotra: session, I think things are building up slowly. You know, a lot of confusion that we had… I had yesterday. I think, you know, it's, you know, coming back on track, so thanks for that. I had one request. I, you know, have the modules sprinted, and I'm, you know, trying to correlate to, you know, with the topics that we're covering.

2104
03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:21.980
Monal S: I mean, one, are we going through the module and sequence? Yeah, see, module has multiple topics, if you see, right? Correct. We are going through modules, but sequence, I might change it a bit. Correct. But not too much, not too much. Modules, we will go in sequence.

2105
03:49:21.980 --> 03:49:34.770
Praveen Girotra: Got it. And the other request is, is it possible for us to kind of get a table with timeline on how many, you know, weeks or months will we be doing, you know, Python and.

2106
03:49:34.770 --> 03:49:52.469
Monal S: I do have that timeline of the previous batch. Yeah, that would help, you know, all I'm looking at is an approximation. Yes, what I'm doing, Beth, I'm trying to add more things and speed up, because the previous batch, I took it more slowly. So I… that will be approximate, but this one will be faster than the previous batch.

2107
03:49:52.470 --> 03:49:58.030
Praveen Girotra: Yeah, I mean, all I'm looking at is an approximation, right? And in the next 3 months, you know, we do maybe Python.

2108
03:49:58.030 --> 03:49:58.610
Monal S: knowledge?

2109
03:49:58.610 --> 03:49:59.690
Praveen Girotra: Something like that.

2110
03:49:59.690 --> 03:50:03.089
Monal S: approximation to all of you guys, alright? I will send in the community.

2111
03:50:03.090 --> 03:50:07.550
Praveen Girotra: Just to understand that big picture, yeah, I appreciate that. Sure, sure. Thank you.

2112
03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:08.780
Monal S: Yeah, thank you, thank you.

2113
03:50:10.300 --> 03:50:12.420
Monal S: Alright, then we have HP.

2114
03:50:12.620 --> 03:50:13.650
Monal S: HP?

2115
03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:20.969
Monal S: Guys, you are seeing two classes for 17, because the recording was large, we have split it into Part 1, Part 2.

2116
03:50:21.290 --> 03:50:26.200
Monal S: Are we clear? 24071A7242.

2117
03:50:26.590 --> 03:50:31.420
Monal S: Guys, whoever doubt is cleared, they can leave this session. Enjoy your weekend.

2118
03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:39.290
Monal S: And thank you for joining, alright? Only people who has doubt, they can… they can stay, or whoever wants to listen to the doubt, they can also stay. Hey, HP, yes?

2119
03:50:39.620 --> 03:50:45.880
HP: Hi, Monal, thank you for the session. I… I just want to have one question that in Python can

2120
03:50:46.080 --> 03:50:54.169
HP: that we will use later for NumPy tabulations. Can hold multiple data types, like string, an integer, and every other thing.

2121
03:50:55.530 --> 03:51:05.960
Monal S: when we work in Python, we can create an array, but usually, when we work with computations, we create an array of a single type. It is an integer, we create with a single data type only, in numpy.

2122
03:51:06.230 --> 03:51:06.710
Monal S: Okay?

2123
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:16.850
HP: Okay, okay. And, one question is related to the previous questions as well, like, we were discussing about the environment. So, since we have, we had created one project which is Level 1,

2124
03:51:16.850 --> 03:51:27.390
HP: So if I have to, like, run multiple environments, so I have to create multiple projects, like, if I have to run level 1 on 3.12, so I'll just execute that.

2125
03:51:27.390 --> 03:51:29.190
Monal S: a new environment, see this, I will tell you.

2126
03:51:29.190 --> 03:51:30.340
HP: Okay. Okay.

2127
03:51:30.340 --> 03:51:41.339
Monal S: And in NumPy, you can also create different values of array, but usually for the numbers, we convert for machine learning, we convert everything to numbers, alright? So don't worry about that. But here, I will talk about… see this.

2128
03:51:46.640 --> 03:51:47.410
Monal S: Yes.

2129
03:51:47.600 --> 03:51:49.829
Monal S: You can see level 1 is ENV.

2130
03:51:50.040 --> 03:51:50.760
HP: Yeah.

2131
03:51:50.760 --> 03:51:53.510
Monal S: You can create another environment within same level.

2132
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:59.939
Monal S: While selecting, while selecting the environment, a new environment will be able to select from here. Are you clear?

2133
03:52:00.430 --> 03:52:03.360
Monal S: Yeah, I'm glad, I'm good. Thank you so much. Yes, yes, you're welcome.

2134
03:52:04.010 --> 03:52:07.489
Monal S: Yes, let me read one request from Arshis.

2135
03:52:08.150 --> 03:52:09.870
Monal S: Ashes, just give me a second.

2136
03:52:10.220 --> 03:52:14.180
Monal S: Ashesh, request to speed up things after… yes, Ashish, this is what I'm planning.

2137
03:52:18.030 --> 03:52:23.859
Monal S: And Ashish, yes, I totally understand, but sometimes what is my problem is.

2138
03:52:24.150 --> 03:52:30.829
Monal S: I… if I don't provide things in depth, it's like, I'm…

2139
03:52:31.520 --> 03:52:40.210
Monal S: how should I say it? If I don't provide in depth, I don't feel good. But I need to find a way in between so that you guys will be able to get the details.

2140
03:52:40.670 --> 03:52:51.800
Monal S: And also the speed. So I'm trying to figure it out, Ashish. But yes, if you see from the batch one, I'm already covering more concepts than the batch one. So I will speed up, yes. Thank you for that, Ashish.

2141
03:52:53.460 --> 03:52:55.670
Monal S: I will take… I will consider that, alright?

2142
03:52:56.600 --> 03:52:57.670
Monal S: Mansi?

2143
03:53:02.920 --> 03:53:04.509
Mansi Atara: Hey, good morning, Mona.

2144
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:05.809
Monal S: Hey, Monty, yes.

2145
03:53:06.150 --> 03:53:15.029
Mansi Atara: Actually, I'm trying to find out the assignments in your resource tab, in the videos, but is it inside the zip folder of the date?

2146
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:21.530
Monal S: It is inside the zip folder, and you will see assignments when I write. Have you seen the recording? How I provided assignment? Nancy?

2147
03:53:21.530 --> 03:53:26.970
Mansi Atara: Okay, you are saying to see the recording and check the assignments? I thought it will be a different folder.

2148
03:53:27.310 --> 03:53:34.620
Monal S: It is not a different folder. Assignments, I was… I am right… I usually write the assignments in the way I'm writing the notes, right?

2149
03:53:34.620 --> 03:53:36.549
Mansi Atara: Sure, sure, then it is okay, I was trying.

2150
03:53:36.550 --> 03:53:42.590
Monal S: When the assignments will be bigger, when the assignments will get bigger, the more coding part, then I will provide a separate assignments file.

2151
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:46.940
Mansi Atara: Sure, sure, no problem. I was confused on that. It is clear. Thank you, thank you.

2152
03:53:46.940 --> 03:53:47.800
Monal S: Yes, you're welcome.

2153
03:53:48.450 --> 03:53:55.009
Monal S: And there are some queries regarding how to check the resource. Guys, I hope everyone is able to see my screen.

2154
03:53:56.080 --> 03:53:57.140
Monal S: Hi, everyone?

2155
03:53:58.430 --> 03:54:07.530
Monal S: how to watch video, how to check resource, and other things. See this. I'm only showing you one time. After that, I will watch every… I will ask everyone to watch day one, day two, day 3.

2156
03:54:08.020 --> 03:54:09.480
Monal S: This is our course.

2157
03:54:10.080 --> 03:54:14.760
Monal S: And, you will not see all of that, you will see Ultimate Data Science Batch 2.

2158
03:54:15.280 --> 03:54:34.409
Monal S: If you click on that, you will see Get Started. These are the playlists Krisha provided if you want to go fast track. You can see RAG is there, Python is there, machine learning is there, if you want to do Fast Track. But these are not the live session. This is live session, you will see 11 gen, 11 gen day 1, day 2. Why? Because the session was very large.

2159
03:54:34.410 --> 03:54:48.960
Monal S: Then 14th gen, we only have one Wednesday class. 17th, we have Day 1, Day 2. Not Day 1, Part 1, Part 2, it means it was divided into two parts. It is the same day class. If you want to check the resource, click on any of the video, you will see Resource section here.

2160
03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:55.640
Monal S: This you will download. This is the same resource which I provide in the community.

2161
03:54:57.750 --> 03:55:01.050
Monal S: Alright? Is everyone clear now how to do it?

2162
03:55:01.690 --> 03:55:06.979
Monal S: Is everyone clear? This will happen For, for all the classes.

2163
03:55:07.970 --> 03:55:08.710
Monal S: Right?

2164
03:55:10.010 --> 03:55:12.419
Monal S: How can we download the live sessions?

2165
03:55:12.620 --> 03:55:18.439
Monal S: you will not be able to download the live session, you have to watch it. If you download, you can upload to Telegram, and then…

2166
03:55:18.560 --> 03:55:19.969
Monal S: That is, again, a chaos.

2167
03:55:20.310 --> 03:55:26.010
Monal S: we will not allow any downloads. You will not be even able to do the screen recording.

2168
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.900
Monal S: Okay?

2169
03:55:28.920 --> 03:55:31.840
Monal S: So… That's… there.

2170
03:55:32.480 --> 03:55:36.770
Monal S: Alright, next is… Muhammad? Sharchil?

2171
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:40.869
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Yeah, hi, I'm…

2172
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:41.900
Monal S: Hello, wait.

2173
03:55:42.570 --> 03:55:49.700
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: I just wanted to ask about, the last part of the…

2174
03:55:50.320 --> 03:56:02.249
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: session. it was like, if you run again and again, it will… it is going to append and append, the data.

2175
03:56:02.250 --> 03:56:02.960
Monal S: Yes.

2176
03:56:04.170 --> 03:56:04.910
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay.

2177
03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:11.990
Monal S: Because, see, if you press call button in your phone multiple times, what will happen? You will call that many times.

2178
03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:13.749
Monal S: Is it different from that?

2179
03:56:15.100 --> 03:56:16.410
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Nope.

2180
03:56:16.410 --> 03:56:24.370
Monal S: Are you able to understand? We are running the… this is cell. We… here, I ran it one time. If I run it again, I'm running another time.

2181
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:29.529
Monal S: But, if I run this, what will happen? Tell me. If I run this, what will happen?

2182
03:56:30.220 --> 03:56:32.050
Monal S: Dummy will become empty again.

2183
03:56:32.270 --> 03:56:32.940
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay.

2184
03:56:33.450 --> 03:56:37.290
Monal S: is empty. Now, if I print the length, what will be the length?

2185
03:56:38.820 --> 03:56:39.630
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Lero.

2186
03:56:40.860 --> 03:56:43.160
Monal S: Because I ran this cell again.

2187
03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:50.209
Monal S: Are you clear? Now it does not have zero hello, and other things. If I print this dummy, what will happen? It is empty.

2188
03:56:50.790 --> 03:56:51.910
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: I'm doing it.

2189
03:56:52.180 --> 03:56:59.329
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay, and these blocks also… multiple blocks also interact with each other also.

2190
03:56:59.980 --> 03:57:00.740
Monal S: What do you mean?

2191
03:57:01.140 --> 03:57:04.520
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: I mean… Yes,

2192
03:57:05.060 --> 03:57:15.960
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: If we, if we, dummy.app, append, if we press that, and we then, previous, one, print.

2193
03:57:16.170 --> 03:57:20.960
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Then it will, again, print all the things.

2194
03:57:21.120 --> 03:57:23.800
Monal S: I will tell you what happens. These are different cells.

2195
03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:27.770
Monal S: Yes?

2196
03:57:29.360 --> 03:57:31.780
Monal S: This is just what? Your UI.

2197
03:57:31.960 --> 03:57:32.490
Monal S: Guess?

2198
03:57:32.490 --> 03:57:33.090
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay.

2199
03:57:33.090 --> 03:57:38.910
Monal S: Behind it, they all share memory. Everything is stored in the RAM, yes?

2200
03:57:39.220 --> 03:57:39.860
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay.

2201
03:57:39.860 --> 03:57:43.960
Monal S: If you write A is equal to 2, in memory, what is the value of A?

2202
03:57:44.400 --> 03:57:45.070
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: True.

2203
03:57:46.770 --> 03:57:49.590
Monal S: If you here make A is equal to 0,

2204
03:57:49.720 --> 03:57:52.299
Monal S: What will happen? A will become 0.

2205
03:57:52.640 --> 03:57:53.240
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Doodle.

2206
03:57:53.240 --> 03:58:02.959
Monal S: If you print A here, or if you print A here, what it will do? Will it bring from here or here? No, it will bring from the memory. What is the value of A?

2207
03:58:03.280 --> 03:58:03.880
Monal S: Zero.

2208
03:58:03.880 --> 03:58:04.700
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Mr. Muto.

2209
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:08.779
Monal S: Again, if you print, 0, because it is printing from the memory.

2210
03:58:10.160 --> 03:58:23.980
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay, okay. And, one more thing you were, telling about, the previous course, 1.0. So, have you given access on, the, on the portal?

2211
03:58:24.730 --> 03:58:31.890
Monal S: you will get access, you might have got access, but if you don't, check with the team, they will give you access. But what you will see, I will show you.

2212
03:58:32.020 --> 03:58:41.229
Monal S: You will see in your courses, you will see two courses if you've enrolled in Data Sense 2. You will see 2.0, and you will also see this course as well.

2213
03:58:43.500 --> 03:58:45.060
Monal S: Are you clear? If you go

2214
03:58:45.630 --> 03:58:54.560
Monal S: courses, if you go to Courses tab in learn.rishnaacademy.com, in courses tab, you will see two courses here, if you have enrolled in 2.0.

2215
03:58:55.780 --> 03:58:57.029
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay, different end.

2216
03:58:57.560 --> 03:58:58.200
Monal S: Yes?

2217
03:58:58.470 --> 03:59:00.740
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: This one and, the, previous one…

2218
03:59:00.740 --> 03:59:01.760
Monal S: This one, this is batch one?

2219
03:59:01.760 --> 03:59:02.590
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay.

2220
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:03.500
Monal S: Are we clear?

2221
03:59:03.500 --> 03:59:05.879
B14A-129086-Muhammad Sharjeel: Okay, okay, I can see. Okay, thank you, thank you.

2222
03:59:05.880 --> 03:59:06.569
Monal S: Yes, you're welcome.

2223
03:59:08.090 --> 03:59:09.660
Monal S: Alright, and…

2224
03:59:11.300 --> 03:59:18.609
Monal S: Rithik Kumar, guys, if you write 10 times, I have a doubt, I have a doubt, what 11 people in the queue is doing.

2225
03:59:20.540 --> 03:59:24.140
Monal S: Retig and others, what 11 people is going to do.

2226
03:59:25.960 --> 03:59:26.980
Monal S: In the queue.

2227
03:59:27.090 --> 03:59:29.969
Monal S: Now, Rithik, I cannot see your hand raised also.

2228
03:59:30.800 --> 03:59:33.699
Monal S: I can see, Rithik Kumar Barnal, you are from last third.

2229
03:59:35.700 --> 03:59:43.760
Monal S: Right? So guys, everyone is on the queue. If you raise a hand, if another person will raise a hand, they will be standing at the last of the queue, just like an appended list.

2230
03:59:44.730 --> 03:59:49.529
Monal S: So it means those persons raise your hands again. It's totally fine, it's totally fine.

2231
03:59:49.640 --> 03:59:52.089
Monal S: But I'm just asking everyone, okay?

2232
03:59:52.340 --> 03:59:56.150
Monal S: Be considerate about others, it's totally fine. I know, everyone understands each other.

2233
03:59:56.450 --> 03:59:59.040
Monal S: But I have to say it one time, right? Don't worry, Redik.

2234
03:59:59.190 --> 04:00:00.889
Monal S: Ashish, you're next.

2235
04:00:00.890 --> 04:00:02.040
Ashish: Hey, hi!

2236
04:00:02.040 --> 04:00:03.070
Monal S: Yes.

2237
04:00:03.070 --> 04:00:15.089
Ashish: So, I just wanted to know, like, there's been, things when I… checking with the Christian Academy, they're saying that AI Pro subscription also is there, apart from this. So, what is that, like, they said that one year of subscription.

2238
04:00:15.090 --> 04:00:26.609
Monal S: AI Pro is a subscription which is not for 3 years, it is for 1 year, but in AI Pro, what… we can check with the sales team what is the latest date? Is it 1 year, 1.5 year? I'm not really sure, alright?

2239
04:00:27.140 --> 04:00:33.809
Monal S: when you buy AI Pro, whatever courses we have till now, okay, you will get subscription of those.

2240
04:00:34.940 --> 04:00:48.069
Monal S: Yes, all courses for that duration, 1 year. This Ultimate Data Science is for 3 years, but when you buy AI Pro, you will not get subscriptions for each and every courses. You will get all of them as a whole.

2241
04:00:49.410 --> 04:00:52.199
Ashish: Okay, whatever you've shown, whatever you've shown just now.

2242
04:00:52.520 --> 04:00:54.850
Monal S: Yes, yes, you will get all of them.

2243
04:00:56.100 --> 04:01:08.309
Monal S: you can check what are the courses you will get from the team, alright? But it is for one year. It is for people who want to learn everything. They are… they are experienced, they want to learn some concepts of the data science, but they also want to learn AgentK and RAG.

2244
04:01:08.310 --> 04:01:17.310
Monal S: If you buy all of these 3 courses, it might be more than the total courses amount. So, AIPro will give you all of them in a package, in a discounted price.

2245
04:01:17.650 --> 04:01:20.590
Ashish: But they are live class? They are live or recorded one?

2246
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:27.499
Monal S: Yeah, live, live, live. See, for the courses that are going live, you will get live. For the courses that are already over, you will get recorded.

2247
04:01:28.470 --> 04:01:33.460
Monal S: Whatever we are going currently, it will be there. Whatever batches are done, you will also see that.

2248
04:01:33.940 --> 04:01:35.790
Ashish: So, but the timing will be closed, then?

2249
04:01:36.740 --> 04:01:56.139
Monal S: That part, see, it totally depends on, as I mentioned, right? It is not for people who are beginners, it is for people who know something, they want to learn, suppose in Ultimate Data Science, you have never learned machine learning. So you will join machine learning classes, but in the parallel, you can join RAG, you can do Agentic AI, RICLEAR,

2250
04:01:56.760 --> 04:02:04.219
Monal S: So, it is for pro, like, people who wants to get all the things, and they think that they will be able to complete it in one year.

2251
04:02:04.760 --> 04:02:10.030
Ashish: Okay, and then how explore, like, if you're going to see the course details and all, so… but.

2252
04:02:10.030 --> 04:02:28.729
Monal S: That details is not available to buy directly, but team will give you that link to buy it. You can check with the team that you can also tell that I have already enrolled in Ultimate Data Science, and I want to buy AI Pro, right? They will be subtracting that amount, and will give you AI Pro, if you require that.

2253
04:02:28.960 --> 04:02:34.619
Monal S: But, again, AI data science, this data science is for 3 years, that one will not be for 3 years.

2254
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:45.060
Ashish: Yeah, and last question, like, that is fine, like, they will give you, whatever the courses, but I just want to, before purchasing, I just want to go through all the courses, like, what kind of courses are there.

2255
04:02:45.060 --> 04:02:52.719
Monal S: See, for that, what you can do, we will not be giving you access to recording just for you to try. What we can do is, I will show you.

2256
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.780
Monal S: Okay?

2257
04:02:54.400 --> 04:02:55.710
Monal S: There's shh…

2258
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:02.910
Monal S: Are you able to see this?

2259
04:03:02.910 --> 04:03:03.690
Ashish: Yes.

2260
04:03:04.460 --> 04:03:12.790
Monal S: Live classes, click on live classes, are you able to see 17 results. These are all the batches that we have done, we are done with, alright?

2261
04:03:13.050 --> 04:03:22.910
Monal S: It also includes Udemy one, but you can see, but what you can do, you can click on details. Let's suppose you want to go with Live Agentic Bootcamp. You will click on details.

2262
04:03:23.180 --> 04:03:27.029
Monal S: Then you will click on enroll now, then you will see this link off.

2263
04:03:27.140 --> 04:03:30.280
Monal S: syllabus. In every page, you will see the syllabus.

2264
04:03:30.610 --> 04:03:31.010
Ashish: Mother's.

2265
04:03:31.010 --> 04:03:33.759
Monal S: labor center and understand whether it suits you or not.

2266
04:03:33.760 --> 04:03:39.340
Ashish: That's what I was looking at you. So the website is different, krishnanag.

2267
04:03:39.340 --> 04:03:43.210
Monal S: Yes, this is the main landing page, this is only for learning.

2268
04:03:44.040 --> 04:03:45.450
Ashish: Can you paste it?

2269
04:03:46.050 --> 04:03:48.080
Monal S: resnag.in, I can paste that.

2270
04:03:49.670 --> 04:03:52.720
Monal S: Yes? Yeah, thank you so much. Yes, you're welcome.

2271
04:03:53.960 --> 04:03:56.760
Monal S: All right, yes, Ashish.

2272
04:03:57.280 --> 04:03:59.449
Monal S: Oh, sorry, I did something.

2273
04:04:04.320 --> 04:04:05.940
Monal S: Tetanya, you are next.

2274
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:09.710
Monal S: Anya?

2275
04:04:09.940 --> 04:04:23.020
Chaitanya: Yeah, hi, Mona. Thank you. Thank you for the great sessions, and it's a really patience to take such a long session. Actually, I have a doubt in a previous session.

2276
04:04:23.020 --> 04:04:33.980
Chaitanya: Related to, virtual enrollment. In my, VC port, I am seeing two, virtual environments. Can you enable…

2277
04:04:34.280 --> 04:04:35.659
Chaitanya: Is that…

2278
04:04:35.660 --> 04:04:37.309
Monal S: Any one which you have installed.

2279
04:04:37.750 --> 04:04:42.759
Chaitanya: Let me… can you enable, my… Yes. Please join as a panelist.

04:04:52.610 --> 04:04:53.260
Monal S: Appreciate it.

2282
04:04:53.260 --> 04:04:54.870
Chaitanya: Is my screen visible now?

2283
04:04:55.170 --> 04:04:57.890
Monal S: Not yet, it will be loading in 2 seconds.

2284
04:05:03.460 --> 04:05:12.039
Monal S: office, I will be planning, because every after Sunday, I plan weekends. But you can check the syllabus to check what topics will be coming.

2285
04:05:13.380 --> 04:05:13.830
Chaitanya: Anything…

2286
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:15.760
Monal S: Yes, HRNA. It is.

2287
04:05:15.760 --> 04:05:23.039
Chaitanya: So, if you see in Lecture as I have created one virtual, environment called Test1.

2288
04:05:23.210 --> 04:05:23.890
Monal S: Okay.

2289
04:05:24.290 --> 04:05:30.369
Monal S: Okay, this one. When I am selecting the kernel… Select it, show me, show me.

2290
04:05:30.540 --> 04:05:32.440
Chaitanya: Okay, this is…

2291

04:05:34.840 --> 04:05:36.839
Chaitanya: Let me open this slide.

2293
04:05:37.080 --> 04:05:40.390
Monal S: Select kernel, select kernel. Select kernel is on top, right?

2294
04:05:41.090 --> 04:05:43.349
Monal S: No, no, top right, top right of the screen.

2295
04:05:43.570 --> 04:05:47.959
Chaitanya: Okay, this one. Okay. When I select kernel, it is showing C here.

2296
04:05:47.960 --> 04:05:51.809
Monal S: Okay, now, you see, don't select it. I will tell you what to do.

2297
04:05:52.360 --> 04:05:55.300
Monal S: Currently, you have opened Level 1, right?

2298
04:05:55.460 --> 04:05:56.130
Chaitanya: Correct.

2299
04:05:56.370 --> 04:06:03.059
Monal S: Right? And… You have opened, actually, UDS2. Can you open with VS Code Level 1 instead of UDS2?

2300
04:06:03.370 --> 04:06:07.909
Monal S: Go to File, and open the folder called as Level 1. Don't open UDS2.

2301
04:06:08.040 --> 04:06:12.209
Monal S: You can… you can close this whole VS Code, it's fine. Close the whole VS Code.

2302
04:06:15.230 --> 04:06:20.060
Monal S: Now, open… yes, Level 1 was there. Go to Level 1.

2303

Monal S: Go to More Options.

2308
04:06:34.890 --> 04:06:40.950
Monal S: Okay, here it is not showing you VS Code? Okay, now open VS Code, and open this Level 1 folder from the VS Code.

Monal S: How can you open lecture? Any of the notebooks?

2317
04:07:11.700 --> 04:07:12.920
Monal S: Open Notebook.

2318
04:07:14.280 --> 04:07:16.950
Chaitanya: Okay, this is new, okay, it's finished.

2319
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:20.060
Monal S: Showing your detecting… okay, okay, can I… let's click on select kernel?

2320
04:07:20.560 --> 04:07:22.320
Monal S: Click on Python Environments.

2321
04:07:23.560 --> 04:07:28.590
Monal S: Okay, okay, so now it is still not showing you that.

2322
04:07:28.770 --> 04:07:32.800
Monal S: So… Wait, wait, wait. Don't do that.

2323
04:07:34.360 --> 04:07:40.079
Monal S: I want you to… Okay, let's… will you be able to create the environment again?

2324
04:07:40.440 --> 04:07:42.249
Chaitanya: Okay, then I need to delete this one.

2325
04:07:42.250 --> 04:07:45.050
Monal S: Delete test one, let's do it again, because…

2326
04:07:45.350 --> 04:07:49.470
Monal S: There is a workaround, but again, I have to do a lot of coding. Yeah, delete it.

2327
04:07:50.130 --> 04:07:52.730
Monal S: Open terminal here, open terminal here.

2328
04:07:53.520 --> 04:07:59.320
Monal S: Also, I think you created insight that, okay, Hmm… yes.

2329
04:08:00.810 --> 04:08:02.190
Monal S: OpenCMD?

2330
04:08:02.780 --> 04:08:05.020
Monal S: do UVENV.

2331
04:08:06.400 --> 04:08:07.300
Monal S: Movie?

2332
04:08:08.020 --> 04:08:09.290
Monal S: V-E-N-V?

2333
04:08:09.740 --> 04:08:11.910
Monal S: ENV. V-E-N-V.

2334
04:08:15.530 --> 04:08:19.119
Monal S: ENV, ENV. You forgot the commands already, Chadania.

2335
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:25.380
Monal S: V, E, and ENV. Environment. E-N-V.

2336
04:08:27.350 --> 04:08:30.019
Monal S: Space, right, test underscore one.

2337
04:08:32.110 --> 04:08:33.230
Monal S: press enter.

2338
04:08:37.960 --> 04:08:39.000
Chaitanya: Yeah, hi.

2339
04:08:39.000 --> 04:08:40.080
Monal S: Are you able to see now?

2340
04:08:40.080 --> 04:08:42.830
Chaitanya: Yes, it is the… it is here. The test one is…

2341
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:46.220
Monal S: You should, you should do parallel to your lecture now, okay?

2342
04:08:46.440 --> 04:08:47.230
Chaitanya: Okay.

2343
04:08:47.230 --> 04:08:48.340
Monal S: It's fine. Done.

2344
04:08:48.610 --> 04:08:49.270
Chaitanya: Yes.

2345
04:08:50.340 --> 04:08:51.420
Monal S: Anything else, Ethania?

2346
04:08:51.420 --> 04:08:53.589
Chaitanya: I, now see, here it is.

2347
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:55.449
Monal S: Yeah, yes, yes, it is working.

2348
04:08:55.450 --> 04:09:05.200
Chaitanya: Got it, yeah. Good. Thanks. One more question, Monal. Regarding this Python sessions, how long it will be, take… how many months?

2349
04:09:05.200 --> 04:09:13.069
Monal S: Approximately, it took… in the previous one, it took around 1.5 months, but this batch, I will be completing it in one month.

2350
04:09:13.660 --> 04:09:14.710
Chaitanya: Okay, one month?

2351
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:15.840
Monal S: That is my plan, that is my plan.

2352
04:09:15.840 --> 04:09:16.950
Chaitanya: Okay, got it.

2353
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:25.649
Monal S: I will be giving an estimate, just like the person asked, right? What is the plan? So, I will give you how batch one happened. Approximate, it will take less than that. Alright?

2354
04:09:25.650 --> 04:09:31.409
Chaitanya: Okay, got it, got it. So, for Python, it will be one month, plus, machine learning, right?

2355
04:09:31.650 --> 04:09:35.069
Monal S: Python, after that, see the syllabus. There is a lot of thing after.

2356
04:09:35.070 --> 04:09:44.050
Chaitanya: Yeah, a lot of the things, yes, correct. A lot of things… lot of things are there, but we are not sure how long those will be taking. We are not new towards 100.

2357
04:09:44.050 --> 04:09:58.489
Monal S: on learning new things, see, if you keep on learning new things, this course and other things will kind of become secondary. I will be kind of your knowledge base, alright? I will be sharing my knowledge. But if you will be like, when course will,

2358
04:09:58.750 --> 04:10:10.690
Monal S: this course will be ending in one year. If you're waiting for one year to end something or to start something, that is a little bad. But once the Python and database part is done, you will be able to build something, alright? So don't worry on that.

2359
04:10:10.690 --> 04:10:14.209
Chaitanya: Okay, got, thank you. Sure, yes.

2360
04:10:15.910 --> 04:10:20.510
Monal S: Vamshi, see, I am planning, but plans…

2361
04:10:20.650 --> 04:10:22.280
Monal S: Anything can happen to the plant.

2362
04:10:24.740 --> 04:10:25.820
Monal S: Right, Vanshi?

2363
04:10:27.400 --> 04:10:28.600
Monal S: Dikran Lala?

2364
04:10:31.890 --> 04:10:32.520
Bikram Lala: Hey, hi.

2365
04:10:32.520 --> 04:10:33.329
Monal S: Hey, Degram.

2366
04:10:34.140 --> 04:10:44.110
Bikram Lala: See, actually, I'm opening this VS Code, but I'm not seeing that yellow color, actually, so just doubting if I'm missing some software in stone.

2367
04:10:44.110 --> 04:10:46.199
Monal S: What do you mean by that yellow color?

2368
04:10:46.200 --> 04:10:46.890
Bikram Lala: Oh…

2369
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:54.980
Bikram Lala: It is, when you are, seeing your folder, right, it is, some highlight, yellow highlight, right?

2370
04:10:54.980 --> 04:10:57.480
Monal S: Ferris, I will tell you. Are you able to see my screen?

2371
04:10:58.350 --> 04:10:59.499
Monal S: You're talking about this yellow?

2372
04:10:59.680 --> 04:11:01.090
Bikram Lala: Things, yeah.

2373
04:11:01.090 --> 04:11:04.350
Monal S: see some other color. It is working or not, are you able to run code?

2374
04:11:04.540 --> 04:11:06.060
Bikram Lala: Yeah, yeah, I'm unable to run.

2375
04:11:06.060 --> 04:11:08.470
Monal S: This is my theme. Okay.

2376
04:11:08.470 --> 04:11:09.460
Bikram Lala: Okay.

2377
04:11:09.460 --> 04:11:22.080
Monal S: You can do any of the themes which you like. If you apply another theme, you can see there are lots of themes here. Select any of them, install it. If you want to click on item, install it, and apply it, you will see a different color. This is just a theme.

2378
04:11:22.460 --> 04:11:24.109
Bikram Lala: I got it, got it.

2379
04:11:24.110 --> 04:11:30.499
Monal S: And if you're not able to see something like this, where it's something like this, all different colors also.

2380
04:11:30.680 --> 04:11:33.140
Monal S: You can also install Python.

2381
04:11:33.620 --> 04:11:45.819
Monal S: But again, that is, again, depends on theme. This might be green for you, yellow for you, based on the theme, but you need to also install this Python. This will help you look for Python keywords and other things more clearly. Okay?

2382
04:11:45.970 --> 04:11:47.859
Bikram Lala: Yeah, we have installed this one, yeah, just…

2383
04:11:47.860 --> 04:11:50.910
Monal S: Alright, that is the other theme part only, okay?

2384
04:11:51.090 --> 04:11:51.959
Bikram Lala: Yeah, thank you.

2385
04:11:51.960 --> 04:11:53.239
Monal S: Yeah, yes, you're welcome.

2386
04:11:54.950 --> 04:12:00.630
Monal S: Right? And, then we have… On this album?

2387
04:12:02.720 --> 04:12:03.890
Pandiselvam: I wanna…

2388
04:12:03.890 --> 04:12:05.919
Monal S: Hello, sorry if I'm not pronouncing your name correctly.

2389
04:12:05.920 --> 04:12:08.699
Pandiselvam: Yeah, yeah, correct.

2390
04:12:08.700 --> 04:12:09.110
Monal S: Yes, yes.

2391
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:20.990
Pandiselvam: Yeah, Mona, yeah, I, yeah, already the two of them, they have an issue with the selected environment, right? So even I tried after your root causing, and still I couldn't, find the resolution. Can you help me here?

2392
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:25.010
Monal S: Alright, sure. Can you please join as a panelist? Yes. Share your screen?

2393
04:12:35.000 --> 04:12:39.580
Monal S: Avine might do it later, but for now, if I do it, people will say.

2394
04:12:39.580 --> 04:12:40.300
Pandiselvam: Brilliant.

2395
04:12:40.300 --> 04:12:48.680
Monal S: Radeep, I know. Radeep, if possible, you can mention your query in the chat, because your name is after two people.

2396
04:12:48.980 --> 04:12:55.239
Monal S: If you can wait, that is fine. Yes, can you please open, CMD? You're working with PowerShell.

2397
04:12:56.380 --> 04:12:57.920
Monal S: That was the first requirement.

2398
04:12:58.820 --> 04:12:59.790
Monal S: Power, sir.

2399
04:12:59.950 --> 04:13:02.970
Monal S: No, no, no. CMD you can open here in VS Code.

2400
04:13:03.250 --> 04:13:08.859
Monal S: Can you see that downward-facing arrow right to the plus button? Right to the plus button?

2401
04:13:09.530 --> 04:13:10.160
Pandiselvam: Okay.

2402
04:13:10.160 --> 04:13:12.349
Monal S: Click on that, and select Command Prompt.

2403
04:13:13.720 --> 04:13:16.259
Monal S: Now you're in command prompt in VS Code, okay?

2404
04:13:16.260 --> 04:13:17.980
Pandiselvam: Okay, okay, understood.

2405
04:13:17.980 --> 04:13:21.770
Monal S: Okay, yes, so I can see this is what you are working with.

2406
04:13:22.220 --> 04:13:27.539
Monal S: But why you have created 17.01.2026 inside your virtual environment?

2407
04:13:30.670 --> 04:13:32.930
Monal S: Why do you have VNV lecture.

2408
04:13:32.930 --> 04:13:36.179
Pandiselvam: But this is the way you have structured the folder, or…

2409
04:13:36.180 --> 04:13:36.850
Monal S: Oh.

2410
04:13:36.850 --> 04:13:38.320
Pandiselvam: highly drawn. Highly drawn.

2411
04:13:38.320 --> 04:13:39.000
Monal S: You did it wrong.

2412
04:13:39.000 --> 04:13:39.790
Pandiselvam: Okay.

2413
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:41.850
Pandiselvam: Okay.

2414
04:13:41.850 --> 04:13:44.680
Monal S: Okay, so, but still, can you please,

2415
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:48.509
Monal S: Okay, let's select on 1801. Can you please select 1801?

2416
04:13:49.480 --> 04:13:51.829
Monal S: Now, select that notebook file, 1801.

2417
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:55.689
Monal S: Okay, and let's select on kernel.

2418
04:13:56.900 --> 04:13:58.289
Monal S: Select on kernel.

2419
04:13:58.780 --> 04:14:00.470
Monal S: Click on Python Environment.

2420
04:14:02.680 --> 04:14:07.749
Monal S: Okay, let's wait. Okay, it is not loading for you, so what you can do, in your terminal.

2421
04:14:08.490 --> 04:14:15.199
Monal S: Okay, do you have the zip I've shared you yesterday? Have you downloaded that zip resource? Yesterday's class?

2422
04:14:15.200 --> 04:14:17.120
Pandiselvam: One more night to yield.

2423
04:14:23.570 --> 04:14:24.550
Monal S: Not downloaded.

2424
04:14:24.900 --> 04:14:29.050
Pandiselvam: Okay, yeah, I have seen that, but I didn't download it.

2425
04:14:34.460 --> 04:14:35.649
Monal S: See if I can look.

2426
04:14:36.860 --> 04:14:38.739
Pandiselvam: You want me to download it now?

2427
04:14:38.740 --> 04:14:39.589
Monal S: Yeah, no, no, no.

2428
04:14:43.250 --> 04:14:49.159
Monal S: in the community, Is the community open?

2429
04:14:49.160 --> 04:14:50.430
Pandiselvam: Yes.

2430
04:14:51.120 --> 04:14:52.970
Monal S: Can you please go to our chat?

2431
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:03.949
Pandiselvam: This latest set. No, no, no, no, no.

2432
04:15:03.950 --> 04:15:09.130
Monal S: Refresh, refresh the page, you will see at the end. Yeah, yeah, this one, this one. At the end, you can see my command.

2433
04:15:09.610 --> 04:15:11.489
Monal S: At the end, at the end of the chat, at the end.

2434
04:15:11.490 --> 04:15:12.730
Pandiselvam: Yeah, yeah.

2435
04:15:12.730 --> 04:15:17.140
Monal S: Copy this, copy this? No, no, just copy. Don't report. I know you were just trying.

2436
04:15:18.490 --> 04:15:19.630
Monal S: Copy this whole thing.

2437
04:15:23.390 --> 04:15:25.249
Monal S: Pop it, go to Terminal.

2438
04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:34.590
Monal S: First, this will not work directly. Can you paste this command in any of this notebook cell, just for rough notes?

2439
04:15:35.160 --> 04:15:37.000
Pandiselvam: Based in any of the notebook cells?

2440
04:15:37.980 --> 04:15:40.320
Monal S: No notebook you have in front of you, right?

2441
04:15:41.570 --> 04:15:42.920
Monal S: You can just paste it.

2442
04:15:43.300 --> 04:15:44.969
Pandiselvam: That, I'm not sure.

2443
04:15:45.350 --> 04:15:47.540
Monal S: okay…

2444
04:15:47.540 --> 04:15:48.309
Pandiselvam: This node.

2445
04:15:48.310 --> 04:15:52.559
Monal S: notebooks that is in front of you, those blacks, where you write code in Python.

2446
04:15:52.740 --> 04:15:54.330
Pandiselvam: Yeah, okay, here.

2447
04:15:54.330 --> 04:15:55.450
Monal S: invested, yeah, why not?

2448
04:15:55.450 --> 04:15:55.910
Pandiselvam: Just…

2449
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:58.350
Monal S: paste any, okay? We will use it later.

2450
04:15:58.350 --> 04:15:59.460
Pandiselvam: Okay.

2451
04:15:59.460 --> 04:16:01.899
Monal S: go to VENV, click on VENV.

2452
04:16:02.760 --> 04:16:05.099
Monal S: In your file, click on VENV.

2453
04:16:05.520 --> 04:16:07.570
Monal S: dot VENV, click on that.

2454
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:09.660
Monal S: Click on that.

2455
04:16:11.640 --> 04:16:15.679
Monal S: Did you create a .vnv of your own? We didn't use UV?

2456
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:18.579
Monal S: Real fast.

2457
04:16:18.580 --> 04:16:21.509
Pandiselvam: I selected through UV only.

2458
04:16:22.220 --> 04:16:29.599
Monal S: Oh, HP, yours is, like, 7-8. No, you have deleted it.

2459
04:16:30.580 --> 04:16:31.270
Pandiselvam: Okay.

2460
04:16:31.270 --> 04:16:38.179
Monal S: Okay, see, just like I showed one person to create that VNV, will you be able to watch the recording and do it.

2461
04:16:38.760 --> 04:16:43.070
Pandiselvam: Okay, UV and VNB, right? Yeah.

2462
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:47.480
Monal S: write UVVENV space, let's write test 1, test underscore 1.

2463
04:16:47.960 --> 04:16:52.080
Monal S: Press Enter. Because you deleted it, you don't even have virtual environment.

2464
04:16:52.230 --> 04:16:56.359
Monal S: Okay, now click on… okay, see? Select kernel, it is loaded.

2465
04:16:56.660 --> 04:17:01.800
Pandiselvam: Okay, okay, then, got it. Oh, I, I hope I didn't remove the manually.

2466
04:17:01.800 --> 04:17:11.859
Monal S: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you remove manually. But also, structure it, right now, the structure does not look good. You can see .vnv, like, level 1v, it all looks… it looks all over the place, alright?

2467
04:17:12.040 --> 04:17:14.119
Pandiselvam: Okay, okay, I will restructure business.

2468
04:17:14.120 --> 04:17:18.479
Monal S: Yeah, restructure this, okay? But don't restructure test 1. Don't create anything inside Test 1.

2469
04:17:18.480 --> 04:17:19.630
Pandiselvam: Okay, okay.

2470
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:21.130
Monal S: Yeah, sure. Thank you.

2471
04:17:21.130 --> 04:17:22.620
Pandiselvam: Thank you.

2472
04:17:24.990 --> 04:17:27.870
Monal S: Alright, Sai. Sai Shanmuki?

2473
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:35.489
Sai Shanmukhi: So sorry, Mona, it's actually a different, name I joined, actually.

2474
04:17:35.490 --> 04:17:36.010
Monal S: Yeah, sure enough.

2475
04:17:36.010 --> 04:17:41.090
Sai Shanmukhi: I just want to… I just want to clarify on one of,

2476
04:17:41.240 --> 04:17:44.780
Sai Shanmukhi: Use, I mean, the code which we had written, can I share?

2477
04:17:45.600 --> 04:17:46.160
Monal S: Cheers.

2478
04:17:48.960 --> 04:17:50.029
Monal S: Yes, Timmy?

2479
04:17:51.440 --> 04:18:00.070
Sai Shanmukhi: I'm not sure whether I'm sharing… Okay, you are sharing. So, can you go to this club entry conditions part?

2480
04:18:00.560 --> 04:18:01.230
Monal S: Fair?

2481
04:18:01.850 --> 04:18:04.910
Sai Shanmukhi: Club entry conditions…

2482
04:18:04.970 --> 04:18:05.700
Monal S: Okay, capital.

2483
04:18:06.230 --> 04:18:06.930
Sai Shanmukhi: move this thing.

2484
04:18:06.930 --> 04:18:07.550
Monal S: it would…

2485
04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:09.350
Sai Shanmukhi: Until here…

2486
04:18:10.040 --> 04:18:11.330
Monal S: is on top…

2487
04:18:13.280 --> 04:18:16.440
Sai Shanmukhi: Where percentage equaled attorney, you mentioned.

2488
04:18:16.440 --> 04:18:17.769
Monal S: Yeah, here, yes.

2489
04:18:18.760 --> 04:18:27.820
Sai Shanmukhi: So here, the statement says, like, person, should be over 18, right? So, here we had mentioned the condition as greater than or equal to

2490
04:18:28.190 --> 04:18:28.860
Sai Shanmukhi: Yes, sir.

2491
04:18:28.860 --> 04:18:31.670
Monal S: It means 18 is also fine. It means 18 is also fine.

2492
04:18:32.420 --> 04:18:35.559
Monal S: If person Age, if I say 18, it will also work.

2493
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:38.199
Sai Shanmukhi: Otherwise, I am the same.

2494
04:18:38.200 --> 04:18:39.020
Monal S: Yeah, yeah.

2495
04:18:39.350 --> 04:18:43.030
Sai Shanmukhi: The statement says, like, should be over 18, so I got a little confused.

2496
04:18:43.290 --> 04:18:49.929
Monal S: See, it is totally up to us. If we say, okay, should be over 18 or equal.

2497
04:18:49.930 --> 04:18:50.489
Sai Shanmukhi: My code is correct.

2498
04:18:50.490 --> 04:18:51.470
Monal S: Right?

2499
04:18:51.470 --> 04:18:51.839
Sai Shanmukhi: If it is.

2500
04:18:51.840 --> 04:18:53.909
Monal S: Only over 18, then, then yes, you are correct.

2501
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:57.439
Sai Shanmukhi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that… okay, that's where I got confused with it.

2502
04:18:57.440 --> 04:18:58.310
Monal S: Okay.

2503
04:18:58.310 --> 04:19:00.049
Sai Shanmukhi: I should use SQL.

2504
04:19:00.050 --> 04:19:02.779
Monal S: Yes, yes, yes. Okay, that was my bad.

2505
04:19:02.780 --> 04:19:06.399
Sai Shanmukhi: I was trying to understand that condition, so I was getting a little confused.

2506
04:19:06.400 --> 04:19:10.239
Monal S: That was my bad of me. This, I have not added, okay?

2507
04:19:10.620 --> 04:19:19.579
Sai Shanmukhi: Okay, okay. And one more thing, Mona, like, people are requesting, like, for a fast track, I mean, I'm not sure where the level which I have, it might be coping or what.

2508
04:19:19.810 --> 04:19:21.380
Sai Shanmukhi: What?

2509
04:19:21.380 --> 04:19:23.490
Monal S: What level do you think you're currently in?

2510
04:19:23.490 --> 04:19:27.930
Sai Shanmukhi: I mean, people are, I think most of the people are expedient when they're looking for a faster.

2511
04:19:27.930 --> 04:19:28.690
Monal S: What's going on now?

2512
04:19:28.690 --> 04:19:29.290
Sai Shanmukhi: I'm not done.

2513
04:19:29.290 --> 04:19:32.219
Monal S: Not experienced. Most of the people are not experienced.

2514
04:19:32.500 --> 04:19:33.520
Sai Shanmukhi: Yeah, even…

2515
04:19:33.520 --> 04:19:44.150
Monal S: other language, but not everyone is from technical. So, it is totally fine to be here. If you feel more confident at some point in time, you can again ask me, I will help you. We do have multiple.

2516
04:19:44.150 --> 04:19:49.859
Sai Shanmukhi: Yeah, I got it, but the request is, like, too fast track, I'm not sure.

2517
04:19:49.890 --> 04:19:58.220
Monal S: No, no, no. People are… people are actually confused that… why there are multiple videos. Should we Google Fast Track and other options? That is their main query.

2518
04:19:58.220 --> 04:19:58.870
Sai Shanmukhi: Okay.

2519
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:59.270
Monal S: But yeah.

2520
04:19:59.270 --> 04:20:00.310
Sai Shanmukhi: Okay, one second.

2521
04:20:00.450 --> 04:20:02.500
Sai Shanmukhi: Okay, thank you, thank you.

2522
04:20:05.150 --> 04:20:09.319
Monal S: Alright, guys, don't worry, you guys, your guys' names are coming.

2523
04:20:09.930 --> 04:20:18.009
Monal S: Jessica… Ishu? Ishu Goyal, you're next.

2524
04:20:19.250 --> 04:20:20.990
Ishu Goyal: Hey, hi Mulan. Am I audible?

2525
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:22.079
Monal S: Yes, you're article.

2526
04:20:22.080 --> 04:20:26.180
Ishu Goyal: Yeah, connect at this side, and go to this session, it was great.

2527
04:20:26.430 --> 04:20:45.020
Ishu Goyal: I have one question, actually, it's regarding the UV and Anaconda. So, I just wanted to know which one is better in UV and Anaconda, as some people are using Anaconda. And, why are we using UV instead of Anaconda? As I see in one of the Udemy course, we have used this Anaconda.

2528
04:20:45.350 --> 04:20:53.559
Monal S: See, I personally have Conda in my system as well. I will show you. Okay. So it's my terminal. If I raise Conda, do I have Conda? I have Conda.

2529
04:20:54.150 --> 04:20:59.749
Monal S: Okay? If I show you my VS Code, if I select kernels, select another kernel.

2530
04:20:59.880 --> 04:21:17.940
Monal S: You will see all of this Mini Conda. These are all the environments of Miniconda, okay? So… Okay, so we can install both of the things, one at a time, I mean, at a time. Whatever, whatever is your liking. See, I will tell you what is the, thing, okay? Conda is also a package distributor.

2531
04:21:18.010 --> 04:21:37.030
Monal S: This is for people who know Conda, say, otherwise don't listen to it, otherwise you'll get confused. Conda is also a package manager, okay? Conda also helps you create environments, alright? UV is also a package manager. UV also helps you create environments, so both of them does the same job, yes?

2532
04:21:37.690 --> 04:21:39.930
Monal S: UV is written in Rust.

2533
04:21:40.540 --> 04:21:48.929
Monal S: And Rust is… Rust works very closely with C++ and hardware. UV allows parallel processing as well.

2534
04:21:49.350 --> 04:22:06.370
Monal S: When you install something, okay? Parallel processing, it allows. Conda does not uses it. Conda is a little heavy, UV is more light, but it does not have a cons, it does not have a pros or cons. It does not have a pros and cons, both of them are good.

2535
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:17.249
Monal S: So, in production, if you want to use something light and quick with less installation, UV is good. If you want to deal with Conda and other things, there… because Conda also has many Conda, right?

2536
04:22:17.360 --> 04:22:19.830
Monal S: Miniconda is the lighter version of Anaconda.

2537
04:22:19.960 --> 04:22:29.430
Monal S: This one, Miniconduct. Both of them are also same. This one gives you more packages, this one gives you less packages, but you can install packages however you like.

2538
04:22:29.850 --> 04:22:32.710
Monal S: You can install, just like we install things with PIP,

2539
04:22:33.050 --> 04:22:43.959
Monal S: you can install things with Conda also. Conda maintains its own thing. You can also install with UV. So all of them are different tools. It's like, I should use VS Code.

2540
04:22:44.230 --> 04:22:49.509
Monal S: I… or I should use cursor, or I should use Notepad++, whatever is to your liking.

2541
04:22:49.660 --> 04:22:56.289
Monal S: But I have used UV because of parallel processing. When you download a lot of packages, right?

2542
04:22:56.600 --> 04:22:59.309
Ishu Goyal: UV can download all of them parallelly.

2543
04:22:59.310 --> 04:23:03.780
Monal S: But in Conda and others, they will download in sequential. Okay, and also, this is lightweight.

2544
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:09.729
Monal S: I personally like Miniconda a lot, but, now I've started using UV.

2545
04:23:11.210 --> 04:23:19.710
Ishu Goyal: Okay, so, when I use both of them, at a single system, I mean, install them in a single system, so there will be no conflict in both of them, right?

2546
04:23:19.950 --> 04:23:22.710
Monal S: I'm also not getting any conflict. Are you able to see?

2547
04:23:23.330 --> 04:23:23.760
Ishu Goyal: Yes.

2548
04:23:23.760 --> 04:23:24.950
Monal S: I also have everything.

2549
04:23:25.700 --> 04:23:26.500
Ishu Goyal: Yeah, yeah.

2550
04:23:26.700 --> 04:23:27.789
Monal S: There is no conflict.

2551
04:23:28.020 --> 04:23:30.860
Ishu Goyal: See, if you understand what environments are.

2552
04:23:30.860 --> 04:23:38.840
Monal S: Invartments are nothing but an isolated system which has its own libraries, and a .exe file.exe file in Windows is nothing but those kernels.

2553
04:23:40.170 --> 04:23:41.290
Monal S: Okay. Alright?

2554
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:42.120
Monal S: How'd it go?

2555
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:43.610
Ishu Goyal: Yeah.

2556
04:23:43.610 --> 04:23:45.370
Monal S: Thank you. Yes, you're welcome.

2557
04:23:46.650 --> 04:23:47.670
Monal S: What?

2558
04:23:48.100 --> 04:23:51.629
Monal S: Pradeep, finally you are here. Hello, Pradeep.

2559
04:23:53.210 --> 04:23:54.890
Pradeep Barik: Yeah. Hi, I wanna.

2560
04:23:54.890 --> 04:23:55.720
Monal S: Hi, Proteep, yes.

2561
04:23:55.720 --> 04:23:56.540
Pradeep Barik: Am I everyone?

2562
04:23:56.770 --> 04:23:57.540
Monal S: You're audible.

2563
04:23:57.920 --> 04:24:00.000
Pradeep Barik: Yeah, it was a good session, actually.

2564
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:03.350
Pradeep Barik: Yeah, I, I have query that,

2565
04:24:03.560 --> 04:24:16.049
Pradeep Barik: Today, actually, we just, like, you just, read us, like, non-primitive data types. So, today, just, I, we learned, least, but there are so many, like, set and.

2566
04:24:16.050 --> 04:24:19.480
Monal S: Not yet. We have just started to list a lot of things.

2567
04:24:19.950 --> 04:24:30.350
Pradeep Barik: Yeah, but I just, I just have a query that, will you, shall we, learn all the non-primitive data types, or at least easy enough for this course, like…

2568
04:24:30.350 --> 04:24:33.350
Monal S: No, no, we have to learn all. We will learn all.

2569
04:24:33.640 --> 04:24:39.749
Pradeep Barik: Okay, okay, that's the query I have, actually, because for machine learning, yeah.

2570
04:24:39.890 --> 04:24:56.570
Pradeep Barik: And in Bitwise operator also, I have some queries, like, in machine learning algorithm, actually, the, computer is, you, you told us, like, your computer is understanding 0 and 1. And, actually, BT is, Bitwise is, doing the same thing.

2571
04:24:56.570 --> 04:25:01.789
Pradeep Barik: So, like, why you, like, igno… like, not ignore, but, just,

2572
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:03.859
Pradeep Barik: Tell, like, us, this is the…

2573
04:25:03.860 --> 04:25:09.019
Monal S: See, your question is, like, why we are even using Python when we can communicate with bitwise operator, 0.

2574
04:25:09.030 --> 04:25:11.149
Pradeep Barik: Yeah. Why Python is there?

2575
04:25:11.550 --> 04:25:14.459
Monal S: So that we don't have to communicate with bitwise operators.

2576
04:25:15.260 --> 04:25:16.360
Pradeep Barik: Okay, okay.

2577
04:25:16.360 --> 04:25:31.680
Monal S: Now, suppose you are an engineer. I'm just giving you an example. You are an engineer who does not know data science, but in your college project, you kind of want to simulate some kind of a CPU, a very small CPU, okay? Or very… some kind of an electronic component.

2578
04:25:31.980 --> 04:25:38.630
Monal S: At that time, the electronic component input is also bits. Electricity, yes?

2579
04:25:39.060 --> 04:25:44.839
Pradeep Barik: If you have those kind of input, can you also simulate those using Python, Bitwise, and other things?

2580
04:25:45.020 --> 04:25:47.799
Monal S: Using gates, NOR gate, XOR gate, yes?

2581
04:25:47.930 --> 04:25:49.610
Monal S: That time, you can use it.

2582
04:25:49.840 --> 04:25:52.020
Monal S: But we as a data scientist, we…

2583
04:25:52.290 --> 04:25:59.239
Monal S: I am ignoring… see, if I talk about Python as a programming language, if I teach you Python for 6 months, that will not be even enough.

2584
04:25:59.610 --> 04:26:05.169
Monal S: We are learning Python for… So that we can develop software for data science.

2585
04:26:05.300 --> 04:26:10.710
Monal S: Okay. But Python can also be used for NASA and other softwares. Are we going to learn all of that? No.

2586
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:12.219
Pradeep Barik: No, no, yeah, I understand.

2587
04:26:12.220 --> 04:26:12.970
Monal S: Yep.

2588
04:26:12.970 --> 04:26:13.510
Pradeep Barik: Yeah.

2589
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:15.830
Monal S: Thanks, thanks. Thanks, Mona.

2590
04:26:16.060 --> 04:26:16.920
Monal S: Thanks, brother.

2591
04:26:18.400 --> 04:26:20.159
Monal S: All right, Pagwan.

2592
04:26:23.650 --> 04:26:24.819
Monal S: Juan, you're next.

2593
04:26:25.090 --> 04:26:30.669
Monal S: Guys, hand raised are not getting less and less. I can see numbers are increasing.

2594
04:26:31.240 --> 04:26:33.830
Monal S: But I'm still here.

2595
04:26:33.940 --> 04:26:36.299
Monal S: Bhagan? Okay, Bhavan, I'm not able to hear you.

2596
04:26:36.300 --> 04:26:40.880
Bhagwan Gupta: I can hear you now. Yeah, there was some issue with my mic.

2597
04:26:40.880 --> 04:26:41.500
Monal S: Yeah, it's fine.

2598
04:26:41.500 --> 04:26:55.149
Bhagwan Gupta: Thank you, sir, and the session was really great. I have two questions. Basically, the first question related to course, we have two courses, you know, reflecting under the courses tab. One is the old one, Ultimate Data Science, and the, the…

2599
04:26:55.300 --> 04:27:06.900
Bhagwan Gupta: Second one is the current one. So, you know, my question was, if we parallelly, you know, complete the first one course, and also attending the live, you know, live classes from you, so will that.

2600
04:27:06.900 --> 04:27:08.720
Monal S: That will be a waste of time.

2601
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:10.409
Monal S: I'm going to teach the same thing.

2602
04:27:12.210 --> 04:27:18.070
Monal S: If you learn Python again, and then watch Python again, why not watch two lectures of the progression one?

2603
04:27:18.440 --> 04:27:20.500
Monal S: You will be further into the course?

2604
04:27:21.090 --> 04:27:28.720
Monal S: Yeah, actually, I, you know, I haven't gone through the syllabus, so that's why I, like, I'll have a question, so…

2605
04:27:29.110 --> 04:27:44.520
Monal S: The bus is also a little different, but you will be able to get through either with V1, V2. And once the machine learning part is done, or deep learning, then you can join this batch whenever it is live. In the meantime, you can complete that. This batch will never be faster than V1, because we have started one year late.

2606
04:27:45.470 --> 04:27:54.610
Monal S: It is a different batch altogether. So you can complete all the parts there, but I will not suggest to go back and forth until you're learning something new here.

2607
04:27:55.400 --> 04:28:02.190
Bhagwan Gupta: No, I'll, you know, I'll be attending live sessions, which is more interactive, just because the course is there, so I thought, like, I'll clarify my doubts.

2608
04:28:02.190 --> 04:28:07.280
Monal S: That is for FastTrack, if you want. That is, like, additional thing which we two guys got. That's all.

2609
04:28:07.890 --> 04:28:08.580
Monal S: Okay.

2610
04:28:09.010 --> 04:28:17.989
Bhagwan Gupta: Sure. So, the second question which I have, you know, my VS Code is not working. I've installed UV and the VS Code as well.

2611
04:28:18.120 --> 04:28:24.959
Monal S: Have you tried whatever I'm showing to other people? Because I'm repeating the same thing. Have you tried all the things I've showed from past…

2612
04:28:24.960 --> 04:28:35.199
Bhagwan Gupta: Yeah, actually, I'm not able to, in fact, create the folder. Earlier, it was working, I don't know what's the issue. I've tried to figure out if you can take a moment.

2613
04:28:35.200 --> 04:28:39.060
Monal S: is here. And Rithik, you are next, okay? Rithik?

2614
04:28:39.170 --> 04:28:40.380
Monal S: Yours is next.

2615
04:28:40.830 --> 04:28:43.550
Bhagwan Gupta: Yeah, I'm sharing my screen, thank you.

2616
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:44.800
Monal S: Interesting, Rebecca.

2617
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:53.339
Bhagwan Gupta: So, here's, yeah, here's my screen.

2618
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:57.409
Bhagwan Gupta: I've installed it, in fact, I'm trying to create folder.

2619
04:28:57.630 --> 04:28:58.990
Bhagwan Gupta: But it's not allowing me.

2620
04:28:58.990 --> 04:29:01.350
Monal S: What is this Python on versus…

2621
04:29:02.480 --> 04:29:05.200
Bhagwan Gupta: Oh, this… Which…

2622
04:29:05.570 --> 04:29:07.740
Monal S: Is this .zip.10A?

2623
04:29:08.820 --> 04:29:13.790
Monal S: I don't know, it was, can you click on File? Can you click on File? Can you click on File?

2624
04:29:15.260 --> 04:29:17.410
Monal S: Click on New Open Folder.

2625
04:29:21.630 --> 04:29:26.370
Monal S: Where is the folder? Okay, okay, no, no, no, no, yes.

2626
04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:28.040
Monal S: Yes, click on it.

2627
04:29:29.010 --> 04:29:32.240
Monal S: Click on… yes, just select folder, click on select folder.

2628
04:29:32.970 --> 04:29:34.550
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay, okay.

2629
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:36.849
Monal S: Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.

2630
04:29:37.890 --> 04:29:43.360
Monal S: I'm not sure how you are arranging all of this, yes. Now go back, press back arrow.

2631
04:29:43.470 --> 04:29:47.700
Monal S: Yes. Now click on Classes Krishnak, just click on it, don't double-click.

2632
04:29:47.700 --> 04:29:48.579
Bhagwan Gupta: To click on Saturday.

2633
04:29:48.580 --> 04:29:50.440
Monal S: folder? Thread folder.

2634
04:29:51.900 --> 04:29:52.750
Monal S: Save.

2635
04:29:53.260 --> 04:29:55.110
Monal S: I think you opened something weird.

2636
04:29:56.380 --> 04:29:57.330
Bhagwan Gupta: I don't know, I'm listening.

2637
04:29:57.670 --> 04:29:58.640
Bhagwan Gupta: Cancel it out.

2638
04:29:58.640 --> 04:30:01.430
Monal S: No, no, you did something wrong.

2639
04:30:01.920 --> 04:30:03.810
Bhagwan Gupta: I'm not getting into audio.

2640
04:30:04.240 --> 04:30:06.359
Monal S: Click on file again, click on File again.

2641
04:30:06.660 --> 04:30:07.110
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay.

2642
04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:09.270
Monal S: First Closure VS Core, first closure VS Core.

2643
04:30:09.270 --> 04:30:09.690
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay.

2644
04:30:09.690 --> 04:30:11.240
Monal S: You have a lot of things open here.

2645
04:30:12.310 --> 04:30:13.420
Monal S: Open again.

2646
04:30:14.170 --> 04:30:15.480
Monal S: Open VS Code.

2647
04:30:16.480 --> 04:30:23.910
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay, my… Oh, there are multiple files, so here it is.

2648
04:30:24.140 --> 04:30:27.079
Bhagwan Gupta: You know, in fact, I've installed it myself.

2649
04:30:27.080 --> 04:30:27.480
Monal S: Closer.

2650
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:30.800
Monal S: Can you close all the tabs that are present in the VS Code?

2651
04:30:31.640 --> 04:30:33.299
Bhagwan Gupta: No, it is not an issue, no.

2652
04:30:33.300 --> 04:30:34.700
Monal S: Can you see tabs?

2653
04:30:36.670 --> 04:30:37.949
Bhagwan Gupta: It's not just like a vocal.

2654
04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:39.719
Monal S: room, we have tabs, right? I can see your tabs.

2655
04:30:39.720 --> 04:30:41.970
Bhagwan Gupta: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see that.

2656
04:30:42.280 --> 04:30:44.640
Bhagwan Gupta: Close everything. Close everything.

2657
04:30:44.880 --> 04:30:46.230
Monal S: Yeah, don't save, don't save.

2658
04:30:47.290 --> 04:30:48.260
Monal S: Close everything.

2659
04:30:48.890 --> 04:30:49.660
Bhagwan Gupta: Good morning!

2660
04:30:50.150 --> 04:30:52.820
Bhagwan Gupta: So, this is closing one by one.

2661
04:30:52.820 --> 04:30:57.810
Monal S: You're… because you're working in app data, Something you did wrong.

2662
04:30:57.920 --> 04:30:58.700
Monal S: Yeah.

2663
04:30:58.880 --> 04:31:03.149
Bhagwan Gupta: I think so, I placed something wrong. That's right.

2664
04:31:03.150 --> 04:31:04.910
Monal S: It's fine. Close this.

2665
04:31:05.340 --> 04:31:10.129
Monal S: Now, click Open File, and then open that folder, Krishnakman. Open, go to File.

2666
04:31:10.130 --> 04:31:10.940
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay.

2667
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.370
Monal S: folder.

2668
04:31:12.880 --> 04:31:15.300
Monal S: No, no, open folder, not file.

2669
04:31:16.080 --> 04:31:18.999
Monal S: Cancel, cancel this operation, cancel this operation.

2670
04:31:19.440 --> 04:31:20.340
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay.

2671
04:31:21.360 --> 04:31:23.699
Monal S: You have to navigate the Guam, okay?

2672
04:31:24.160 --> 04:31:27.380
Bhagwan Gupta: open for… okay, I mistakenly clicked on file.

2673
04:31:27.400 --> 04:31:30.479
Monal S: Yeah, now just click on, yeah, select folder, yes.

2674
04:31:31.320 --> 04:31:33.389
Bhagwan Gupta: Should I select the Kristen again?

2675
04:31:33.390 --> 04:31:35.089
Monal S: Not yet. Sarah Krishnak?

2676
04:31:35.250 --> 04:31:36.400
Monal S: necessary holder.

2677
04:31:37.430 --> 04:31:38.400
Bhagwan Gupta: Don't say that.

2678
04:31:38.400 --> 04:31:40.120
Monal S: Don't save, don't save, don't save, don't save.

2679
04:31:40.660 --> 04:31:41.510
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay…

2680
04:31:44.670 --> 04:31:46.990
Bhagwan Gupta: I pressed on.

2681
04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:48.229
Monal S: Oh, see what a fake.

2682
04:31:48.360 --> 04:31:49.120
Monal S: I'm not so…

2683
04:31:49.120 --> 04:31:50.410
Bhagwan Gupta: I'm so sorry, so…

2684
04:31:50.410 --> 04:31:50.860
Monal S: It's totally.

2685
04:31:50.860 --> 04:31:51.400
Bhagwan Gupta: Yeah, I'm…

2686
04:31:51.400 --> 04:32:02.090
Monal S: Fine. But I will suggest to better see, practical live is good you create it, but start from where I was talking about how to create directories, what we should follow, because in practical life, you should be creating folders.

2687
04:32:02.090 --> 04:32:04.599
Bhagwan Gupta: Right? Just like I was doing.

2688
04:32:04.600 --> 04:32:11.470
Monal S: You created like me, that is good, that is good. But try to navigate to the VS Code, how to open folders, how to do things, then you will understand. Okay?

2689
04:32:11.580 --> 04:32:13.319
Bhagwan Gupta: Definitely, I, you know…

2690
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:21.939
Bhagwan Gupta: Yes, sir. Okay, I was trying that, but somehow, you know, these things were not importing into this, so I was like, if I installed it wrong…

2691
04:32:21.940 --> 04:32:27.970
Monal S: whenever you click on save now, it was not redirecting, so you should cancel it, okay? It will not come now, it will not come.

2692
04:32:27.970 --> 04:32:31.519
Bhagwan Gupta: Okay, thank you so much, Melissa. I'll make sure to do it next.

2693
04:32:31.520 --> 04:32:31.860
Monal S: Yeah.

2694
04:32:31.860 --> 04:32:32.309
Bhagwan Gupta: Thank you.

2695
04:32:32.310 --> 04:32:33.120
Monal S: Thank you.

2696
04:32:33.580 --> 04:32:34.100
Bhagwan Gupta: Bye.

2697
04:32:34.400 --> 04:32:34.980
Monal S: Bye-bye.

2698
04:32:35.080 --> 04:32:36.470
Monal S: And then, Rithik?

2699
04:32:37.520 --> 04:32:38.440
Monal S: Retik?

2700
04:32:39.010 --> 04:32:41.820
Ritik kumar barnwal: Hey, hi Monal. It's Claudeville, right?

2701
04:32:42.110 --> 04:32:43.140
Monal S: Yes, yes.

2702
04:32:43.140 --> 04:32:50.349
Ritik kumar barnwal: Yeah, firstly, I'm so sorry for slamming over the chat, like… No, no, it's totally fine. Yeah, I understand, but I also have to communicate, right?

2703
04:32:50.350 --> 04:32:51.560
Monal S: Yeah, that's true.

2704
04:32:51.560 --> 04:33:16.400
Ritik kumar barnwal: So, actually, I just had a one doubt. See, first of all, you guys are putting a lot of efforts for creating this type of content for us, and of course, I'm just following Krishna from the last 3 years, I guess. So, I just had a one doubt, like, what should we do? Like, since you are, like, teaching on the live classes, should we follow the same, like, while you are doing the coding things over the VS Code and all the stuff? So, should we follow the same, like, we should

2705
04:33:16.400 --> 04:33:18.789
Ritik kumar barnwal: do coding at the simultaneously.

2706
04:33:18.790 --> 04:33:19.900
Monal S: I will tell you.

2707
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:25.269
Monal S: What… I will tell you what I do, because everyone's story is different, everyone learns differently, right?

2708
04:33:25.270 --> 04:33:25.710
Ritik kumar barnwal: Yup.

2709
04:33:25.710 --> 04:33:45.110
Monal S: So, everyone needs to figure it out. Everyone who stayed till now, there are 75 people stay till now. So, everyone needs to figure it out what works for them. Some people like books. I personally, I have books, you can see books. And, I never went even page 10, because for some reason, that doesn't work for me.

2710
04:33:45.439 --> 04:33:54.740
Monal S: And in terms of that coding, when I started my coding, started learning coding, I was more interested in understanding, getting comfortable with what exactly is code.

2711
04:33:54.950 --> 04:33:58.470
Monal S: I started coding after 3 months after learning coding.

2712
04:33:59.000 --> 04:34:15.819
Monal S: my base, C, C++, okay? Little bit. So, what you can do, you can figure it out if, while writing, beside me, like, watching the live classes you wanted to write and practice it, if that may… if that is increasing your anxiety that I'm not able to do it, don't do it.

2713
04:34:15.900 --> 04:34:25.009
Monal S: But if you feel that you are comfortable doing it side-by-side, you're not… you're not losing focus, then do side-by-side coding. But if you're losing focus.

2714
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:27.950
Monal S: I am already giving you what code I'm writing, yes.

2715
04:34:28.210 --> 04:34:29.209
Ritik kumar barnwal: Yeah, that's funny.

2716
04:34:29.210 --> 04:34:32.859
Monal S: What you can do, you can just revise it once the class resource is uploaded.

2717
04:34:34.400 --> 04:34:35.159
Monal S: That's all?

2718
04:34:35.480 --> 04:34:41.829
Monal S: Practice it, change it, do permutation combinations on that. Resource will always be available if you want the original file, yes?

2719
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:42.560
Ritik kumar barnwal: Okay.

2720
04:34:43.270 --> 04:34:57.790
Monal S: So do experimentation on the file which I provide, if that is the way you like. If you're not getting… if you're not feeling… feeling anxious that… what is going on in the live class? Did I miss something? Did I miss something? Then don't do side-by-side coding. Let's do it!

2721
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.660
Monal S: It's totally.

2722
04:34:58.669 --> 04:34:59.359
Ritik kumar barnwal: Right.

2723
04:34:59.529 --> 04:35:12.209
Ritik kumar barnwal: Yeah, actually, you know, why I ask this? Because, see, I've been, like, into tech field, like, I've been learning all these things since my college days, and I have, like, around total 3 years of experience in corporate, but not in the technical side.

2724
04:35:12.209 --> 04:35:20.689
Ritik kumar barnwal: So, you know, I just want to switch in that. And I even tried all the things, like, to, like, for some other… when I was doing the development things for the DS and all.

2725
04:35:20.689 --> 04:35:27.309
Ritik kumar barnwal: while, keeping the sessions and just doing the coding simultaneously, so I was not able to, cope up with that thing.

2726
04:35:27.619 --> 04:35:30.239
Ritik kumar barnwal: So, I was just not able to figure it out, so that's why.

2727
04:35:30.240 --> 04:35:31.179
Monal S: It's funny trick.

2728
04:35:31.180 --> 04:35:32.049
Ritik kumar barnwal: Okay, yeah.

2729
04:35:32.250 --> 04:35:46.969
Monal S: Same. That's good. So when I'm going to give you assignment from next week, everyone's going to give assignment, then you can do your coding, then there you can practice your skill, but if you're not able to do it alongside the class, don't do it. Don't at all try. Just look at the concept.

2730
04:35:46.970 --> 04:35:57.860
Monal S: Just look… because I'm the one writing the code, just look at the syntax and everything. No need to remember anything, ChatGPT is here, Google Gemini's here, who's going to write the code, but understand what is there, why it is there, alright?

2731
04:35:58.099 --> 04:36:09.090
Ritik kumar barnwal: Yeah, that's correct. And the last thing, Manal, I wanted to ask, so in this course, like, like, at the end of this course, you'll cover all the things, like, how you can build the SMS for everything in there, no?

2732
04:36:09.249 --> 04:36:10.339
Monal S: Everything.

2733
04:36:11.169 --> 04:36:11.830
Ritik kumar barnwal: So, yeah.

2734
04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:14.360
Monal S: Whatever we have promised, we always give more than that.

2735
04:36:14.590 --> 04:36:27.269
Ritik kumar barnwal: Yeah, I know, like, because I'm following Chris from the last 3 years, and you know, like, I was very curious to learn AI, like, from being in a non-technical background, like, in a non-technical corporate experience, I would just want to switch my career into AI and all the things.

2736
04:36:27.610 --> 04:36:28.430
Monal S: Great, awesome.

2737
04:36:28.720 --> 04:36:31.069
Ritik kumar barnwal: Yeah, so yeah, that's all. Thanks, Monu. Thank you so much.

2738
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:32.110
Monal S: Sure thing, thank you.

2739
04:36:32.960 --> 04:36:35.390
Monal S: Alright, Srinath, you're next.

2740
04:36:36.860 --> 04:36:37.749
Monal S: Do you not?

2741
04:36:38.439 --> 04:36:39.559
Shreenath: That's me.

2742
04:36:39.560 --> 04:36:42.660
Monal S: your queue is after Srinath. Yes, Srinath, yes.

2743
04:36:42.669 --> 04:37:02.429
Shreenath: Can you hear me? Yes, yes, Mono. So, I have just one quick question. First of all, thank you for the classes and the session, whatever you are conducting. So, I've just been… I've just created one project, and under the one project, I have created two environments. Okay, suppose environment 1, version… Python version 1.2, and second environment, version… Python version 2.0.

2744
04:37:02.429 --> 04:37:09.189
Shreenath: Now what we are… now what I am doing, I'm just changing the environment to version from 2.2 to 3.2.

2745
04:37:09.459 --> 04:37:21.649
Shreenath: So, what is happening here, under the environment 2, there is a one file, like PYEVENB.configure, where version info is not getting changed, that's the same.

2746
04:37:21.650 --> 04:37:25.579
Monal S: No, don't… create a new environment, why you want to change it? Create a new environment.

2747
04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:27.050
Shreenath: Okay.

2748
04:37:28.290 --> 04:37:30.129
Shreenath: Can I share my screen?

2749
04:37:30.130 --> 04:37:30.700
Monal S: Super.

2750
04:37:32.540 --> 04:37:33.300
Monal S: Yes.

2751
04:37:33.950 --> 04:37:37.989
Monal S: Okay, when you're creating a new environment, the Python version is still the same, you're saying?

2752
04:37:40.759 --> 04:37:41.770
Monal S: You're not?

2753
04:37:43.040 --> 04:37:43.680
Shreenath: Hello?

2754
04:37:44.169 --> 04:37:45.149
Monal S: Hello? Yes.

2755
04:37:45.680 --> 04:37:46.840
Shreenath: Can you see my skin?

2756
04:37:47.550 --> 04:37:53.829
Monal S: It is not yet loaded. So the issue is, you are creating a new environment, but the Python is still the same, yes?

2757
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:55.270
Shreenath: Yes, yes, yes. Okay.

2758
04:37:55.270 --> 04:37:55.630
Monal S: Every time.

2759
04:37:55.630 --> 04:37:57.660
Shreenath: I have crea… yeah, tell me.

2760
04:37:57.869 --> 04:38:01.619
Monal S: Okay. See, you do… I understand your issue. Are you able to see.

2761
04:38:01.619 --> 04:38:02.079
Shreenath: MSK.

2762
04:38:02.380 --> 04:38:03.830
Monal S: Can you show me again? Yes, yes.

2763
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.759
Monal S: Okay.

2764
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:07.550
Shreenath: Yeah.

2765
04:38:07.550 --> 04:38:10.929
Monal S: Alright, this is my terminal, let me open CMD.

2766
04:38:11.279 --> 04:38:12.289
Monal S: I don't know.

2767
04:38:12.950 --> 04:38:18.059
Monal S: And it was closed, yes, I don't want it Let me minimize a bit.

2768
04:38:18.259 --> 04:38:19.309
Monal S: How do I look at myself.

2769
04:38:19.779 --> 04:38:30.170
Monal S: Okay, so currently we are able to see this level 1, and here we are able to see that I have Python 3.1212, right? Correct. You are saying that you are changing version info here.

2770
04:38:30.599 --> 04:38:36.629
Shreenath: Yes. No, no, I'm not changing here. I am not changing here. I'm just, installing, UV.

2771
04:38:36.630 --> 04:38:39.850
Monal S: Okay, if you're installing something, let me install some dummy one.

2772
04:38:40.090 --> 04:38:41.499
Monal S: This is what you're doing?

2773
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:43.290
Shreenath: Yes, yes, correct.

2774
04:38:43.290 --> 04:38:46.860
Monal S: Okay? Now, if you write this code again, what will happen?

2775
04:38:47.400 --> 04:38:50.980
Monal S: You are… did you remember that? UV…

2776
04:38:51.430 --> 04:38:55.439
Monal S: Do you remember that code which I shared before? I will show you that.

2777
04:38:56.310 --> 04:39:06.410
Shreenath: No, no, Monol, I think… I think under… different understanding. What I am doing, I have one project. Under one project, I have created two environments.

2778
04:39:06.419 --> 04:39:09.079
Monal S: environment, I'm also creating another environment.

2779
04:39:09.080 --> 04:39:14.480
Shreenath: another environment. Then, what I am doing now, I am changing the Python version for the.

2780
04:39:14.480 --> 04:39:14.800
Monal S: How are you?

2781
04:39:15.200 --> 04:39:17.530
Monal S: the Python version, how you're changing the Python version?

2782
04:39:18.150 --> 04:39:20.470
Monal S: What is the code you are changing the Python version?

2783
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:24.269
Shreenath: just… I'm just doing the experiment. So, what time…

2784
04:39:24.279 --> 04:39:33.749
Monal S: No, you should not do like that, you should not do like that, okay? It might break something, because when we install something, the dependencies of those files also comes with us.

2785
04:39:33.939 --> 04:39:35.239
Monal S: Are you clear on that?

2786
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:37.779
Monal S: So what we need to do, just, I will show you.

2787
04:39:41.369 --> 04:39:42.759
Monal S: That was weird, a second.

2788
04:39:48.359 --> 04:39:49.359
Monal S: See this?

2789
04:39:49.489 --> 04:39:56.109
Monal S: UVPython list when I do, how many versions of Python I have in my system, you will see all of these Pythons, okay?

2790
04:39:56.890 --> 04:40:06.089
Monal S: These are all the Python lists available from the UV, but not in my system. These are in my system. You can see, this is what version? 3.14. This is 3.12. This is 3.12.

2791
04:40:06.090 --> 04:40:06.610
Shreenath: No.

2792
04:40:06.780 --> 04:40:10.040
Monal S: These are all the versions available in my sister, along with UV has those.

2793
04:40:11.680 --> 04:40:16.530
Monal S: If I do UV, V, and V, and just write dummy 1.

2794
04:40:16.740 --> 04:40:17.140
Shreenath: Yes.

2795
04:40:17.140 --> 04:40:24.309
Monal S: Alright? It will create with Python 3.1212. Why? Because in my UV, I've already selected it.

2796
04:40:24.630 --> 04:40:29.030
Monal S: So what I need to do? What I need to do, I need to pin the Python version.

2797
04:40:29.330 --> 04:40:31.310
Monal S: Do you remember the command where we used.

2798
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:35.630
Shreenath: Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. UB Python pin, Python button, yes.

2799
04:40:35.630 --> 04:40:40.379
Monal S: Jovi, Python, Pain, I will say, let's say, 3.14.

2800
04:40:40.520 --> 04:40:43.470
Shreenath: Yes, correct? Is the version pinned?

2801
04:40:43.880 --> 04:40:44.540
Shreenath: Yes.

2802
04:40:44.540 --> 04:40:48.010
Monal S: If you see, dummy 1 already has 3.12.

2803
04:40:48.300 --> 04:40:49.439
Shreenath: Yeah, because we don't want it.

2804
04:40:49.440 --> 04:40:59.379
Monal S: which we don't want, right? So I'm going to delete dummy one, and let's create… because now I paint the 3.14. If I create dummy one again, it was created with…

2805
04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:03.700
Monal S: 3.14, are you able to see in my terminal?

2806
04:41:03.870 --> 04:41:05.249
Shreenath: Yes, yes, correct.

2807
04:41:05.250 --> 04:41:08.500
Monal S: If I do W1 now, are you able to see 3.14?

2808
04:41:08.500 --> 04:41:16.060
Shreenath: Okay, you mean we need to delete that environment again? We need to pin it first, because UV, how you will know what Python you want?

2809
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:19.710
Monal S: First, pin the UV, then do the creation. Done.

2810
04:41:19.710 --> 04:41:27.559
Shreenath: Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. I'm just, I'm just saying it will be, automatically, will be changed in that, computation file?

2811
04:41:27.560 --> 04:41:28.520
Monal S: No, no.

2812
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:29.430
Monal S: C.

2813
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.810
Shreenath: Okay.

2814
04:41:29.810 --> 04:41:38.210
Monal S: If you, if you download and… if you want to use latest version of Android, can you change the file name and Android will change? No, you need to download the whole files.

2815
04:41:38.650 --> 04:41:46.359
Shreenath: Okay, okay, okay. It's me, we need to… first, we need to pin the letters, but then delete that environment, and okay, okay, thank you, thank you.

2816
04:41:46.360 --> 04:41:47.940
Monal S: Yes, okay.

2817
04:41:49.120 --> 04:41:55.040
Monal S: Okay, HP, you are… Not HP. HP, you are next.

2818
04:41:56.960 --> 04:41:57.920
Monal S: That's P?

2819
04:41:58.740 --> 04:42:00.389
Monal S: Did we already talk before?

2820
04:42:01.870 --> 04:42:02.770
hp: Hello?

2821
04:42:02.770 --> 04:42:03.650
Monal S: Hello? HP?

2822
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:04.900
hp: Yeah, I'm out well.

2823
04:42:04.900 --> 04:42:07.460
Monal S: No, no. Oh, yes, hello, you have heard about it.

2824
04:42:07.920 --> 04:42:14.680
hp: So, yeah, my question is, like, I'm aiming for Gen AI developer or Gen AI engineering role.

2825
04:42:14.850 --> 04:42:22.149
hp: So, will this, Ultimate DS course will be enough, or, after completing this, I need to do any further thing?

2826
04:42:23.790 --> 04:42:29.400
Monal S: Enough depends on the industry and where you're applying. If you want to apply at Google, this is not enough.

2827
04:42:29.580 --> 04:42:33.629
Monal S: If you want to apply at startups, if you want to apply at MNC, this is enough.

2828
04:42:35.800 --> 04:42:38.180
Monal S: Okay, this will… this will be enough, right?

2829
04:42:38.530 --> 04:42:43.879
Monal S: This will be enough, but if tomorrow some new topic requires, What will you do?

2830
04:42:44.450 --> 04:42:46.359
hp: We need to let the… yeah.

2831
04:42:46.960 --> 04:42:50.480
Monal S: Alright? So if something is not a part of the course and the industry, it'll change.

2832
04:42:50.880 --> 04:42:57.779
Monal S: It is you who have to do the work. But at current environment, current, for 3-4 months, this course is more than enough.

2833
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:59.999
Monal S: Okay? But if you want to become

2834
04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:02.910
Monal S: test engineer, then I need to learn more things.

2835
04:43:03.370 --> 04:43:08.110
Monal S: This is a beginner-intermediate level, but for advanced level, we have different things.

2836
04:43:08.290 --> 04:43:09.070
Monal S: Okay?

2837
04:43:09.070 --> 04:43:13.980
hp: Okay, one more question I have, like, my answer introduced some,

2838
04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:19.500
hp: AI Automation, Udemy course, so we can do parallel with this, and…

2839
04:43:19.500 --> 04:43:22.760
Monal S: that does not require coding. If you have time, you can do paralleling.

2840
04:43:23.170 --> 04:43:26.979
hp: Okay. And one more, like, a few more,

2841
04:43:27.200 --> 04:43:32.340
hp: Like, multiple, courses that, my answer showed. So, what will be the sequence of…

2842
04:43:33.420 --> 04:43:34.340
Monal S: Hey, first, as.

2843
04:43:34.340 --> 04:43:35.369
hp: If I want to do.

2844
04:43:35.370 --> 04:43:52.069
Monal S: are told that today Manchester shared one course, which tells you AI plus ANIT. So, if you complete that, you will understand… you will have an understanding of AI. And if you want to go further and specialize into Annet L, then go to the course which Manzar previously shared 2-3 days back.

2845
04:43:52.260 --> 04:43:53.310
Monal S: Are you clear?

2846
04:43:53.820 --> 04:43:54.150
hp: Okay.

2847
04:43:54.150 --> 04:44:13.269
Monal S: That is a specialization of NATN, the current course which mine are shared in this class today. Here, it is more about AI, what is NATN, what we can do with those. It is more about understanding all the things. Just like Ultimate Data Science, Ultimate Data Science gives you understanding of everything. But if you want to learn REG specifically, then we have a REG course.

2848
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:14.840
Monal S: Are you able to understand now?

2849
04:44:15.360 --> 04:44:20.180
hp: Yeah, yeah. So that will be part of Gen AI, that init and something?

2850
04:44:21.280 --> 04:44:29.500
Monal S: NATAN is a part of automation. It is not a JNEI. NATN automation uses GenAI. That's why you need to understand what exactly things are. HP, are you clear?

2851
04:44:29.500 --> 04:44:31.709
hp: Okay, got it, Mundo. Thank you.

2852
04:44:31.870 --> 04:44:32.690
Monal S: Thank you.

2853
04:44:33.070 --> 04:44:34.900
Monal S: Tajesh, you are next.

2854
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:38.539
Monal S: Guys, please lower your hand once you're done.

2855
04:44:40.780 --> 04:44:42.000
sajesh nair: Yeah, hi, hi one.

2856
04:44:42.000 --> 04:44:43.140
Monal S: Hey, Sajesh, yes.

2857
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:48.989
sajesh nair: Yeah, manila, I wanted to discuss on the yesterday's assignment, which you had given.

2858
04:44:49.770 --> 04:44:52.350
sajesh nair: Regarding that, creating that.

2859
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:57.419
Monal S: From the terminal, we need to create that, you know, so can I once share my screen? I mean.

2860
04:44:57.420 --> 04:45:00.079
sajesh nair: The environment, everything has got resolved.

2861
04:45:00.340 --> 04:45:03.490
Monal S: I just want to show you, there is one command.

2862
04:45:05.310 --> 04:45:07.959
Monal S: Okay, I'm promoting it to panelists. Please join.

2863
04:45:17.070 --> 04:45:18.100
Monal S: Yeah, that's cool.

2864
04:45:19.100 --> 04:45:31.650
Monal S: Kaushik, you… we have 3 people, and guys, after 3 people, I will not take. Satish is the last person. After Satish, I will not take any other questions. Because if you keep raising by understanding the number, it will… it is going to create

2865
04:45:31.780 --> 04:45:33.429
Monal S: Unnecessary chaos for me.

2866
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:39.599
Monal S: Satish is the last person, Kaushik is the last second, Venkata is the first one after this. Yes, tell me.

2867
04:45:39.600 --> 04:45:41.069
sajesh nair: Yeah, can you see my screen?

2868
04:45:41.540 --> 04:45:42.650
Monal S: I can see your screen.

2869
04:45:43.210 --> 04:45:48.260
sajesh nair: Okay, so yesterday's assignment, which you had said that, you know, we need to create the folders in this way.

2870
04:45:48.260 --> 04:45:54.380
Monal S: Yeah, you should not create in Level 1. It is a separate assignment. Assignment… don't mix up your assignment in this level, because here you are.

2871
04:45:54.380 --> 04:45:56.550
sajesh nair: No, no, no, I've created separate… that I've created a separate.

2872
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:57.240
Monal S: Guys.

2873
04:45:57.240 --> 04:45:59.280
sajesh nair: For assignment, I've just created separately.

2874
04:45:59.280 --> 04:46:00.440
Monal S: That's great, that's great, awesome.

2875
04:46:00.440 --> 04:46:05.740
sajesh nair: Yeah, so I have created this kind of steps in that key, how we can create, and I've created it separately itself.

2876
04:46:05.970 --> 04:46:21.210
sajesh nair: So, in that, one of the command to create a IEPN by file was copycon, and the name of the file which I wanted to create. So, basis that I've created today's lecture… today's class lecture, CopyCon 18th Gen IPN by.

2877
04:46:21.210 --> 04:46:22.700
Monal S: That's great. That's great.

2878
04:46:22.700 --> 04:46:32.380
sajesh nair: So, yeah, so I've created it in this way, but, you know, when I was trying to, you know, search for any codes in ChatGPT now, most of them are providing it in PowerShell.

2879
04:46:32.530 --> 04:46:33.559
sajesh nair: But, you know…

2880
04:46:33.560 --> 04:46:43.390
Monal S: You need to write terminal. If you need to specifically write it, PowerShell uses a different kind of a command. If you write CMD in Windows, and I want command for that, you will get command from CMD.

2881
04:46:43.880 --> 04:46:48.099
sajesh nair: Okay, but you said we should not use PowerShell, so what is the difference?

2882
04:46:48.100 --> 04:47:02.319
Monal S: No, see, PowerCell uses a different command. Terminal is… the CMD is very lightweight. PowerShell is used more for… it is more for advanced user. So I want… I want you all to be familiar with some kind of a base coding, okay? Later, when you get senior.

2883
04:47:02.320 --> 04:47:08.320
Monal S: You will even forget Windows, and everything will be Linux command. Mac uses Linux-based terminal.

2884
04:47:08.400 --> 04:47:20.769
Monal S: And Linux already uses Linux, the command will also change, but this way you will understand that, how to work with Terminal to just move around the OS. That's the main goal. Goal is not you to learn Windows. Goal is to use…

2885
04:47:20.770 --> 04:47:22.539
sajesh nair: command, right? This is the correct command.

2886
04:47:22.540 --> 04:47:30.359
Monal S: I… when I was showing in my terminal, I was showing you something else. This is a different command. There are different ways to create a file, okay?

2887
04:47:30.360 --> 04:47:32.329
sajesh nair: Okay, this isn't CMD only, I've created in CMD.

2888
04:47:32.330 --> 04:47:39.110
Monal S: Yeah, I was using something else, but this is a different command. Okay, it's fine. If you're able to create it, note it down your notes, it's fine.

2889
04:47:39.420 --> 04:47:46.969
sajesh nair: Yeah, I've noted it down, but I'm not sure if this error is coming, I'm not sure why this is coming, so I just wanted to show you if I'm doing it correctly.

2890
04:47:47.540 --> 04:47:48.310
Monal S: No.

2891
04:47:49.610 --> 04:47:50.150
sajesh nair: Can you see this?

2892
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:51.830
Monal S: This is while creating, this is while.

2893
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:57.429
sajesh nair: No, no, no, now when I saw this, it was showing some problems in 17 and 18 Jan.

2894
04:47:57.430 --> 04:48:01.290
Monal S: Because you're getting invalid syntax, it means something you have written code incorrectly.

2895
04:48:02.900 --> 04:48:03.980
Monal S: Okay. In the…

2896
04:48:03.980 --> 04:48:05.430
sajesh nair: the system, okay?

2897
04:48:05.430 --> 04:48:07.179
Monal S: Yes, if you go to…

2898
04:48:07.180 --> 04:48:10.300
sajesh nair: Yes, line or column, is it this way? How do we read this?

2899
04:48:10.300 --> 04:48:18.830
Monal S: This is… I personally don't use that problems one. Are you able to run the code in the… are you able to run code in the notebook?

2900
04:48:18.830 --> 04:48:21.909
sajesh nair: Yeah, yeah, I can, I can run it, but I'm not sure if it is covered the problem.

2901
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:24.209
Monal S: Don't worry about these problems, ignore it.

2902
04:48:24.660 --> 04:48:28.030
sajesh nair: not an issue, because later the VS Code should not get, you know.

2903
04:48:28.440 --> 04:48:30.380
Monal S: No, no, no, no, no, it's totally fine.

2904
04:48:30.870 --> 04:48:32.349
sajesh nair: Yeah, yeah, thanks.

2905
04:48:32.350 --> 04:48:33.400
Monal S: Yeah? Yeah.

2906
04:48:33.400 --> 04:48:34.070
sajesh nair: design.

2907
04:48:34.330 --> 04:48:34.950
Monal S: Simple.

2908
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:37.910
Monal S: Alright,

2909
04:48:42.260 --> 04:48:45.670
Monal S: Then we have… Venkrita? Venkrita?

2910
04:48:45.920 --> 04:48:47.390
Monal S: You know, the last third.

2911
04:48:48.820 --> 04:48:51.339
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: Hi, Munel, thanks for… hi.

2912
04:48:51.610 --> 04:49:00.280
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: Just, like, I have one question. So, yesterday… I mean, like, I missed yesterday's session, but I've gone through the videos and followed to create the, you know…

2913
04:49:00.460 --> 04:49:08.560
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: kernel. So currently, what I have done, I have created two, folders, one is level 0 and level 1.

2914
04:49:09.120 --> 04:49:27.910
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: And, if I'm going to the folder level 1, I'm able to enable the kernel, you know, version, whatever I'm doing. But if I'm coming to the practical, folder, if I want to switch, you know, I can see both the folders now, level 0 and level 1.

2915
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:41.969
Monal S: That is the error which we have seen. For some reason, our VS Code, along with UV, is not able to look into two different folder, two levels of folder, okay? So go in one, work with one. And in real world, when you create a project, project is always a single level.

2916
04:49:42.290 --> 04:49:46.130
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: Okay, okay, yeah. Single level, I'm able to do, that's not an issue.

2917
04:49:46.130 --> 04:50:01.079
Monal S: That is the issue. I will need to check why VS Code is not able to handle it. Not just VS Code, maybe we will check with some other ID, but that is the issue with VS Code and UV. It is not able to find the packet. UV works, but locating it is kind of creating an issue.

2918
04:50:01.610 --> 04:50:14.390
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely fine, like, see, if I want to activate the level 0, I'm able to do the activate, I'm able to run the, files, but only thing, the kernel, it is using the global one, not the, you know?

2919
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:17.219
Monal S: is not able to find the coroner which we created, right? Yes.

2920
04:50:17.220 --> 04:50:18.680
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: Yes, yes, yes, that is the part.

2921
04:50:18.680 --> 04:50:20.799
Monal S: Yeah, make sure that you create in the same level.

2922
04:50:21.130 --> 04:50:22.580
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: I did the same level, yes.

2923
04:50:22.580 --> 04:50:24.249
Monal S: Yeah, that's good, Venkuta, that's good.

2924
04:50:24.520 --> 04:50:33.349
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: Yeah, yeah, that's it, like, okay, it is something problem with, you know, other than that, my, my, yeah, whatever setup I did, it is not an issue, so that's all, yeah, yeah.

2925
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:34.809
Monal S: That's good, that's different, you know.

2926
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:37.010
Venkata thrinadhareddy koyya: Yeah, yeah, thank you very much, yeah, thank you.

2927
04:50:39.210 --> 04:50:42.910
Monal S: Alright, Kaushik, finally you are here, last second is Kaushik.

2928
04:50:44.850 --> 04:50:45.730
Monal S: Hashik?

2929
04:50:47.700 --> 04:50:49.629
Monal S: Thanks for staying till now.

2930
04:50:51.250 --> 04:50:52.770
Monal S: I know you're fixing your mic.

2931
04:50:57.690 --> 04:51:00.200
Kausik Khanra: We just… Hello, can you hear me?

2932
04:51:00.200 --> 04:51:02.039
Monal S: Hello? Hey, Kashy, yes, I can hear you.

2933
04:51:02.620 --> 04:51:17.300
Kausik Khanra: Yeah, yeah, thanks. So I have a question, like, you showed how to pin that a particular version of Python in UV, right? So, UV pin, that is the command is, UVPython pin 3.12, or something like that.

2934
04:51:18.030 --> 04:51:27.079
Kausik Khanra: My question is, I did that, and that's fine, but when you were creating a new environment with a different version of Python, have you showed that how to do that?

2935
04:51:27.080 --> 04:51:28.649
Monal S: I just showed now with PIN, right?

2936
04:51:29.120 --> 04:51:41.850
Kausik Khanra: Yes, that's fine, but my question is 3.12, that is pinned, okay, there. And I have created one environment with that particular Python version. And now I want to create another environment with a different version, so…

2937
04:51:41.850 --> 04:51:47.239
Monal S: Install the Python. Now, first you need to install the Python version using UVPython. We have seen that code, right?

2938
04:51:47.240 --> 04:51:47.620
Kausik Khanra: Yes.

2939
04:51:47.620 --> 04:51:54.919
Monal S: in the lecture 1. You need to install the version of Python which is not available in Fishtown. Once it is installed, pin that version, and then create the environment.

2940
04:51:55.600 --> 04:52:03.039
Kausik Khanra: Yeah, I did that, but my question is, when I'm creating another environment, do I need to delete the previous environment?

2941
04:52:03.040 --> 04:52:07.349
Monal S: No, you don't delete it. I deleted it because I don't want all the environments. I only want the.

2942
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:08.640
Kausik Khanra: Got it, got it, got it.

2943
04:52:08.980 --> 04:52:10.940
Kausik Khanra: I can create multiple environments.

2944
04:52:10.940 --> 04:52:15.709
Monal S: Yeah, create tons of it. Yeah, create 10 environments you like, but make sure that the names are different.

2945
04:52:16.150 --> 04:52:19.279
Kausik Khanra: Yeah, definitely, yeah. That answers my questions. Thanks, Muno.

2946
04:52:19.330 --> 04:52:21.199
Monal S: That's accurate. Thank you.

2947
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:30.250
Monal S: Alright, finally, Satish, last person, and we all, Done. Yes, Satish?

2948
04:52:30.570 --> 04:52:31.540
Satish Yadav: Hello, munar.

2949
04:52:31.540 --> 04:52:33.520
Monal S: Awesome profile picture, by the way. Is this you?

2950
04:52:33.520 --> 04:52:34.870
Satish Yadav: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm…

2951
04:52:34.870 --> 04:52:35.759
Monal S: Yeah, that's great.

2952
04:52:35.760 --> 04:52:37.519
Satish Yadav: So, finally, my chance come.

2953
04:52:38.090 --> 04:52:39.969
Monal S: Yes, finally, you're the last one.

2954
04:52:40.380 --> 04:52:42.249
Satish Yadav: Yeah. So, can I share the screen?

2955
04:52:42.800 --> 04:52:44.659
Monal S: Yes, first, tell you what is your issue.

2956
04:52:44.870 --> 04:52:54.659
Satish Yadav: The issues in the file section, though my file section is very meshed up, my .vnv file…

2957
04:52:54.840 --> 04:52:55.780
Satish Yadav: Any issues?

2958
04:52:55.780 --> 04:52:57.760
Monal S: Join as a panelist, join as a panelist.

2959
04:53:00.930 --> 04:53:02.769
Satish Yadav: Yeah, once again, yeah.

2960
04:53:03.320 --> 04:53:07.780
Satish Yadav: So, here you can see… Hello.

2961
04:53:07.780 --> 04:53:09.209
Monal S: I'm not able to see your screen.

2962
04:53:11.050 --> 04:53:11.760
Satish Yadav: month.

2963
04:53:13.540 --> 04:53:14.719
Satish Yadav: Now you can see.

2964
04:53:15.300 --> 04:53:19.189
Monal S: I can… I think it will load after 2-3 seconds. Let's speed.

2965
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:24.469
Monal S: It's not yet.

2966
04:53:26.730 --> 04:53:27.350
Satish Yadav: Excellent.

2967
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:40.140
Monal S: I can see people answer how many Python lectures more, guys, we have started Python in, and you guys are saying how many more Python lectures?

2968
04:53:40.800 --> 04:53:43.329
Monal S: Here to learn something or complete something?

2969
04:53:44.470 --> 04:53:45.450
Monal S: Others?

2970
04:53:46.010 --> 04:53:49.749
Monal S: Whoever stayed till now, guys, are you here to learn something or complete something?

2971
04:53:52.770 --> 04:53:53.800
Satish Yadav: Is it visible?

2972
04:53:55.150 --> 04:53:56.409
Monal S: But there's not yet.

2973
04:53:57.000 --> 04:54:00.560
Monal S: Learn, thank you. There are a lot of people who are here to learn.

2974
04:54:00.740 --> 04:54:04.300
Monal S: But there are people who just want this course to be end tomorrow.

2975
04:54:04.400 --> 04:54:06.350
Monal S: So that they can apply to the jobs.

2976
04:54:07.680 --> 04:54:13.120
Monal S: The skills works like that? Skill works like adding hashtag in your resume?

2977
04:54:15.200 --> 04:54:15.900
Satish Yadav: Oh, it's…

2978
04:54:15.900 --> 04:54:17.630
Monal S: Yes, I can see your screen now, yes.

2979
04:54:17.830 --> 04:54:19.499
Satish Yadav: So, there's a file section.

2980
04:54:19.500 --> 04:54:27.569
Monal S: Hmm, it is all over the place. Where is your file? You have created VNV in Site 17, you have created VNV as a level 1 VNV.

2981
04:54:27.570 --> 04:54:31.629
Satish Yadav: when I… when I create a file, so it's going in VNV.

2982
04:54:32.160 --> 04:54:45.270
Monal S: It is not going, actually. It happens, but you should not create it. You can drag and drop outside, but I will suggest… see what I will suggest you, okay? Yeah, yeah. You have your main files, which I'm sending as a resource.

2983
04:54:45.650 --> 04:54:55.519
Monal S: Keep it in the download, delete everything, start, just, like, very simple. Because right now, you have to fix a lot of things, and UB creating an environment takes 3 seconds, yes?

2984
04:54:55.760 --> 04:54:56.490
Satish Yadav: Yeah.

2985
04:54:56.490 --> 04:55:04.099
Monal S: So it's better to delete everything, create environment, never touch, never create anything inside that environment. And I told you to create how to name an environment.

2986
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:07.330
Monal S: If you don't name an environment, it will be .venv.

2987
04:55:07.890 --> 04:55:15.410
Monal S: Yes, if you want to name environment, you will write UV, VENV, and then the name of the environment, that command. Yes?

2988
04:55:16.490 --> 04:55:17.580
Monal S: This is a lot, yep.

2989
04:55:17.580 --> 04:55:19.890
Satish Yadav: What is here happening, butler?

2990
04:55:20.210 --> 04:55:26.920
Satish Yadav: I want… when I select this, this, kernel, the code is running, not… not running yet.

2991
04:55:27.280 --> 04:55:28.140
Satish Yadav: But…

2992
04:55:28.140 --> 04:55:30.640
Monal S: It's because the environment got deleted.

2993
04:55:31.050 --> 04:55:31.760
Satish Yadav: Oh.

2994
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:37.260
Monal S: You can see, the kernel failed to start as Python enrollment. It is not able to find 3.12.12.

2995
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:38.190
Satish Yadav: Click on level.

2996
04:55:38.190 --> 04:55:39.449
Monal S: Level 1, click on Level 1.

2997
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.960
Monal S: No.

2998
04:55:40.960 --> 04:55:41.430
Satish Yadav: algorithm.

2999
04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:42.340
Monal S: It might work.

3000
04:55:42.930 --> 04:55:44.460
Satish Yadav: He's, the problem.

3001
04:55:44.460 --> 04:55:49.010
Monal S: Don't install, always install, always install. If you don't install it, it will not work. It will take some time.

3002
04:55:49.400 --> 04:55:53.790
Satish Yadav: The pop-up says.

3003
04:55:54.130 --> 04:56:00.570
Monal S: Okay, were you able to see the code, or, see, please copy and paste the command which I sent in the group.

3004
04:56:00.800 --> 04:56:07.709
Monal S: Okay. In our community, okay, check that. And once you install that environment, I will give you your task, okay?

3005
04:56:07.970 --> 04:56:12.369
Monal S: Wait, Satish, you can take the screenshot in our chat, okay?

3006
04:56:12.670 --> 04:56:14.259
Monal S: Okay. Satish.

3007
04:56:14.620 --> 04:56:18.169
Monal S: Can you please say hi so that I can write the scene for you?

3008
04:56:19.770 --> 04:56:21.539
Satish Yadav: From Zoom, in Zoom.

3009
04:56:21.540 --> 04:56:24.089
Monal S: Yeah, in Zoom chat, can you please say hi?

3010
04:56:24.530 --> 04:56:25.240
Satish Yadav: We'll ask.

3011
04:56:25.690 --> 04:56:27.630
Monal S: Delete everything.

3012
04:56:29.240 --> 04:56:35.439
Monal S: Second… create VNP with a name.

3013
04:56:35.940 --> 04:56:38.600
Monal S: You know how to activate an environment from terminal?

3014
04:56:39.770 --> 04:56:40.600
Satish Yadav: No.

3015
04:56:41.860 --> 04:56:44.539
Monal S: Okay, you need to watch recordings, Satish.

3016
04:56:45.010 --> 04:56:47.390
Satish Yadav: What… what? Yes.

3017
04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:51.950
Monal S: Yesterday's doubt session, if you watch yesterday's doubt session, I was the same,

3018
04:56:52.280 --> 04:56:58.609
Monal S: Activate the environment, okay? Yeah. Activate… I'm just going to write the steps, you can ask ChatGPT also, okay?

3019
04:56:58.610 --> 04:57:00.060
Satish Yadav: Okay, okay, okay.

3020
04:57:04.180 --> 04:57:08.169
Monal S: always use CMD, okay? Okay, you're in Mac, right?

3021
04:57:08.170 --> 04:57:08.729
Satish Yadav: Right, right.

3022
04:57:08.730 --> 04:57:10.290
Monal S: courtesy. That's fine.

3023
04:57:10.570 --> 04:57:14.900
Monal S: From terminal, then… Use this command which I'm using.

3024
04:57:15.170 --> 04:57:18.430
Monal S: And then… Fifth?

3025
04:57:20.850 --> 04:57:23.570
Monal S: Use notebooks.

3026
04:57:30.260 --> 04:57:31.900
Monal S: Are you able to see the chat?

3027
04:57:31.900 --> 04:57:32.420
Satish Yadav: Yeah, yeah.

3028
04:57:32.420 --> 04:57:33.979
Monal S: Send to everyone, okay?

3029
04:57:33.980 --> 04:57:36.330
Satish Yadav: So first, I have to delete everything, right?

3030
04:57:36.330 --> 04:57:41.799
Monal S: Yes, yes. Take a first… capture this from your phone, and then solve it later, okay?

3031
04:57:42.600 --> 04:57:43.599
Satish Yadav: Okay, got it.

3032
04:57:45.310 --> 04:57:56.340
Monal S: You will be able to do it, Satish. And there are people in our community which will help you. Now I will ask each and every one, because it's not you, because other people have done it so many times. They will also help you, okay?

3033
04:57:57.080 --> 04:57:58.810
Satish Yadav: Okay, one second, I can see the screen.

3034
04:58:00.040 --> 04:58:01.480
Satish Yadav: No, okay, done.

3035
04:58:02.980 --> 04:58:03.910
Satish Yadav: Thank you.

3036
04:58:03.910 --> 04:58:04.350
Monal S: Yeah, you're.

Satish Yadav: Give him a response.

3038
04:58:05.460 --> 04:58:06.690
Monal S: Yeah, thank you.

3039

Monal S: Hey, you too. Have a nice day.

3041
04:58:10.170 --> 04:58:18.230
Monal S: Alright guys, we are finally done, and thank you very much, guys, for joining today's session. This is end of our first week.

3042
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:30.229
