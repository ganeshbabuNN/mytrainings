33
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:52.419
Krish Naik: Many people will also ask, Krish, after the live session, do we get the recordings or not? So that also we'll be discussing about.

34
00:20:52.570 --> 00:21:01.249
Krish Naik: I'll be talking about our platform, I'll be talking about our features, you know, so many features that we have brought for you. If…

35
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:16.360
Krish Naik: at any point of time, or any point of time you face any kind of problems, where do you go ahead and reach out? All those information also I'll be providing, okay? So, are we good to start with? Yes? Can I get a quick yes? Please give some kind of thumbs up.

36
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:31.419
Krish Naik: Happy emoji, you know? I know many of you right now are only being able to chat, you'll not be able to unmute yourself. The reason is very simple, because… I'll tell you, because we want to take this session in a proper way, and in the later stages.

37
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:46.280
Krish Naik: After the session gets over, we will take all your questions. We'll be there till everybody's question is basically answered, okay? I know today is an induction session. People will be quite interested to ask, sir, how to get into this, how to get into that and all, right?

38
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.090
Krish Naik: Okay, I'll be sharing my screen.

39
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.510
Krish Naik: Can you give me a quick confirmation if you're able to see my screen, everyone?

40
00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.710
Krish Naik: Okay?

41
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.660
Krish Naik: Yes, Mona, you are able to see my screen, right?

42
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.660
Monal Kumar: Yes, sir, yes, sir.

43
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:13.759
Monal Kumar: Yeah, guys, I… we really love your energy. Yes, guys, please be interactive on the chat. It really helps us, and we can see that you guys are very excited. Okay, Krisha, yes.

44
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.520
Krish Naik: Okay.

45
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:20.179
Krish Naik: So guys, right now, I hope everybody has got the dashboard access.

46
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.300
Krish Naik: Yes or no?

47
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:36.300
Krish Naik: So, if you have not got the dashboard access, initially, if you want to go ahead and access your dashboard, it is very simple. See, first of all, there are two main platforms that we are specifically developing, right? So, one is Krishnak.in.

48
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:49.649
Krish Naik: Here, we have listed all the live courses, right? So this is your course over here, 2.0 Ultimate Data Science and Gen AI Bootcamp. And similarly, you can see all the other courses, okay?

49
00:22:49.790 --> 00:23:05.529
Krish Naik: Inside this live courses, when you click over here, so here you will be able to see this, and I hope everybody has enrolled it from here. When you enroll, you have to go ahead and log in in learn.krishnakacademy.com. So this is the LMS platform that we have.

50
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:21.320
Krish Naik: Where all our courses are hosted, okay? Courses and this entire platform that you'll be able to see. The reason why we are using this platform, because here, nothing is being advertised in front of you. Here, the complete focus is on

51
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:27.790
Krish Naik: teaching, learning, you just need to… if you're coming in this learn.krishnakacademia.com platform.

52
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:48.529
Krish Naik: Here, the entire focus is that you are able to learn things over here, right? So, here I will be talking about, once you log in, right? Go ahead and log in over here, guys. Learn.krishnakacademy.com. Please go ahead and log in with your email ID or phone number. You'll be getting an OTP, and you should be able to log in. Just give me a quick confirmation if you're able to log in or not.

53
00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.710
Krish Naik: Okay?

54
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.339
Krish Naik: Yes, I think that mail information also you have actually got, each and every information.

55
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:02.089
Krish Naik: Yeah, perfect. Now, I can see that many people are saying, yes, we are able to log in, this is good, perfect.

56
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.440
Krish Naik: Now.

57
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:15.180
Krish Naik: Let's talk about some important section over here that you see in this particular page. So, I have also logged in as a user who has taken a course from Krishnaik, okay?

58
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:21.449
Krish Naik: Okay? And then, you see over here, the first section, that is nothing but feed.

59
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.450
Krish Naik: Do you see this feed, everyone?

60
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.329
Krish Naik: The feed means what?

61
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.110
Krish Naik: This feed basically means it's just like a LinkedIn feed.

62
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:42.729
Krish Naik: Like, so many people have joined our courses, you know? So they do a lot of conversation within their particular courses. They like to post their work, like, what they have actually done.

63
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:54.629
Krish Naik: Okay, so here you'll be able to see, everybody's able to see this specific post, because I have posted this in our batch, 2.0 Ultimate Data Science and Generative AI and Agent API Bootcamp.

64
00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:03.679
Krish Naik: Yeah? So here, you'll be able to see that many people will be commenting, they'll be putting a hard scene, like, you can see 1.5K people have seen this particular post.

65
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.200
Krish Naik: Yeah?

66
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:17.789
Krish Naik: Priya, if you're facing that particular problem, please contact our counseling team. You have the number, okay? If you say that your mail could not be verified, you just contact our counseling team, they'll help you out, okay?

67
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:40.750
Krish Naik: So, here, you'll be able to see this. I think everybody's able to see this particular post. So, in order to do this post, you just need to go over here, go ahead and write whatever things you want. Let's say that today, you have learned some amazing Python project, okay? And this is what you really want to share over here. So, you can just go ahead and write it over here and publish it. So, this feed will go to your entire network.

68
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.580
Krish Naik: In this particular batch.

69
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.450
Krish Naik: Now, how many people have probably attending this particular badge? They will be able to see that particular post.

70
00:25:47.990 --> 00:26:03.849
Krish Naik: The reason why we made this, why we are using this feature, because if you want to make connections with your team, if you want to probably go ahead and have a problem, tomorrow you want to go ahead and attend a hackathon, you can just go ahead and ping it over here, or post it over here, many people will be able to participate. Okay?

71
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.390
Krish Naik: Clear, everyone.

72
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.869
Krish Naik: Everyone clear? Yes? Yes or no?

73
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:19.819
Krish Naik: Okay, so here, if you go ahead and see below, so many, see, so many learnings. People will be posting over here what they are developing, what they are not developing, everything.

74
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:35.509
Krish Naik: Right? It may be videos, it may be YouTube channel, it may be anything. So they're posting, they're posting their learnings, they're developing amazing things, right? And, no, it'll not be available in the internet, it will only be available over here in our platform.

75
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:50.220
Krish Naik: Yeah? Feed is public to everyone based on the batches. So let's say this guy is available, is in Live Agentic AI and Generative AI bootcamp, so whenever he posts over here, all the students who are from this specific batch will be able to see it.

76
00:26:51.250 --> 00:27:11.159
Krish Naik: Make sense, everybody? Yes? So you'll be able to see what kind of learning they are doing. They're developing some amazing application, architecture, right? Jay and Krishna, yes, since you have joined only 2.0 bootcamp, none of your peop… none of your teammates have posted anything right now, right? So only one message you'll be able to see, that is mine.

77
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.330
Krish Naik: Okay?

78
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:26.849
Krish Naik: So here you can see all the posts, all the learnings, this is from all the previous batches, like how we have developed, and people are developing amazing workflows by using Enitin, by using Langraph, Langchain. It keeps on going on.

79
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:44.369
Krish Naik: Right? So it's been more than one year that we have started our bootcamps. Just imagine the kind of efforts people have actually put. This, we can definitely see from the transition stories of all our students who have made into multiple industries, right? So this is amazing, right?

80
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.609
Krish Naik: Okay, so understood about the fleet section? Yes?

81
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.140
Krish Naik: Understood about the fleet section?

82
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:52.620
Krish Naik: Yep.

83
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.360
Krish Naik: Perfect. I think everybody's saying yes, so this is good.

84
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.309
Krish Naik: Now, the second one is the workshop session.

85
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:07.299
Krish Naik: Now, can anybody tell me what is this workshop session? It is simple, right? You will be getting your meeting link over here.

86
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:14.100
Krish Naik: Right? What, like, today's session, you'll be able to see this. There is… this one you'll not be able to see.

87
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:32.730
Krish Naik: Because this is another batch that is going on parallelly. This is a RAG batch that is going on parallelly at this time, in a different Zoom link, okay? But here is yours. So you have got your induction session, you can go ahead and join over here. I have been enrolled in both the batches as a student, so I'll be able to see this in our feeder.

88
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.550
Krish Naik: Sorry, in the workshop, right?

89
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:44.079
Krish Naik: Yes, yes, RAG will also be taught. Clear, everybody? Is my voice echoing, everyone?

90
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.850
Krish Naik: Mona, is my voice echoing?

91
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.219
Monal Kumar: But it is good.

92
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.409
Monal Kumar: It's almost just 2-5%, but it is fine.

93
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.950
Monal Kumar: Yep.

94
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:55.200
Krish Naik: Let me check…

95
00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.709
Krish Naik: It should not echo anyhow.

96
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.230
Monal Kumar: It is good, it is good.

97
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.109
Krish Naik: It should not occur. No, it should not occur.

98
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.910
Monal Kumar: Okay, yeah.

99
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.100
Krish Naik: I have a very good mic, man. I have a 25K mic.

100
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.670
Krish Naik: Okay? I'm so proud of my mic. Okay?

101
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.290
Krish Naik: Okay, so…

102
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:29.489
Krish Naik: Very good thing is that, at any point of time, I think you have also got the mail for your classes, right? Okay. How many of you have received the mail? Yes?

103
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:48.879
Krish Naik: How many of you have received the mail? Yes, you also received the mail. So, we also send the mail. Along with that, at any point of time you feel that, hey, your mail may have gone into spam folder or promotion folder, you can just go ahead and have a look over here in the workshop session to understand. Like, let's say that today is the session, 11th.

104
00:29:48.880 --> 00:30:01.159
Krish Naik: Then, you'll be having the next session on Wednesday, then the next session on Saturday and Sunday, like that, okay? I'll be talking more about it, like, when you'll be having the session and whatnot. So, this is the induction session 2.0, okay?

105
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:21.990
Krish Naik: So, similarly, at any point of time, this will be enabled just 15 minutes before the class. You'll be able to get the Zoom link, and you'll be able to join it from here itself. Okay, so perfect, you have received it, you have received the mail, and everything as well. So, this is the workshop session. Wherever we keep the session, here, the session link will be available.

106
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.299
Krish Naik: Then, coming to the next part, that is courses.

107
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:34.920
Krish Naik: Now, what is this course is? This is your course dashboard, okay? So right now, if I go ahead and click on Start Learning, here is the induction session, okay?

108
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.310
Krish Naik: You do not see any, so here I put some prerequisite videos.

109
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:46.930
Krish Naik: But, other than that, whenever the live session gets over, after 24 hours, these recordings will be uploaded over here.

110
00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.510
Krish Naik: Clear?

111
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:55.140
Krish Naik: After 24 hours, the video will get uploaded over here.

112
00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:12.739
Krish Naik: Why do we take 24 hours, Krish? It takes time, because our session goes ahead till 3 to 4 hours for that particular video to be processed by Zoom, you know, it will definitely take some time. Once that video comes to us, then we upload it over here.

113
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:14.860
Krish Naik: Clear?

114
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:27.759
Krish Naik: Yes? Yes, Pratiba, in both your feed and workshop, only one induction session will be shown, because you're only enrolled in 2.0 batch. If you're enrolled in multiple batches, all that particular course dashboard will be shown.

115
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:42.890
Krish Naik: Clear? So this course section that you see, you'll be able to see all the access of all the other courses that you have joined. Do you see this 2.0 Ultimate Data Science and Ultimate Data Science and Gen AI Bootcamp access?

116
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.829
Krish Naik: Do you see both these Xs?

117
00:31:46.500 --> 00:32:04.909
Krish Naik: Yeah? Why you're seeing this? Because this is the batch that is already taking place, and many people were asking for the previous batch recordings, so we started giving… so here also you can see the induction session. Here, also, you can see Anaconda installation, right? And here you can see Mona also.

118
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:15.930
Krish Naik: Yeah? Mona also. So, if anyone wants to get it, Vihan, no, sir, I cannot wait for one month, sir, I want to see the recordings. Go and see the recordings, everything is over here.

119
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.630
Krish Naik: Right? And here you'll also get an idea, like, how we specifically teach.

120
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:33.059
Krish Naik: Mano Josie, you should be able to see the batch access, because whoever has got the excess of 2.0 batch will be able to get that particular access also of 1.0.

121
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:52.370
Krish Naik: No, the live… the entire course will not be ripe broadcast on YouTube. YouTube have just streamed because the induction session is there. Okay? So, and in Krishnak Academy, we are doing everything in this way. In the further… if you join any batches also, we have the recorded version of that particular batch.

122
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.660
Krish Naik: Okay.

123
00:32:54.380 --> 00:33:00.659
Krish Naik: Means the previous batch also, like, 1.0, we will also be giving for every batches that comes in the future also.

124
00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:01.780
Krish Naik: Okay.

125
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:17.290
Krish Naik: Okay? So here, what you can do, you can go ahead and check it out. Here, also, all the resources, materials is basically given. You can see, right now, ML, ML, everything. Like, no, sir, I want to go very quickly, like Shatabdi. Okay, go!

126
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:24.010
Krish Naik: Content is there, everything is there, you're teaching, you're learning, monolash taught.

127
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:37.679
Krish Naik: We are also trying to bring multiple mentors so that you get the best experience out of everyone, okay? That also I'll talk about, you know? No sir, I want to only learn from you. Don't worry about that also. I will give my recordings also.

128
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:48.359
Krish Naik: Okay, I will give, personally, my recordings, I'll… I also want to bring monol experience in front of you, so that you get to understand multiple things, you get to understand multiple perspectives.

129
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:57.629
Krish Naik: Okay? 2.0 will be same as 1.0, no. 2.0 will be more advanced than 1.0, because there are new things that have actually come up.

130
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.159
Krish Naik: Okay? Perfect.

131
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:10.300
Krish Naik: Everyone? So in the courses section, whatever courses you have actually got, the access of, that you will be able to see it over here.

132
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.690
Krish Naik: Clear?

133
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.169
Krish Naik: Perfect. Now, there is also one more section, which is called as Level Up.

134
00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:22.769
Krish Naik: This level up, don't worry right now, I have not enabled it, but we are going to keep some challenges over here.

135
00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:36.880
Krish Naik: Okay? Challenges, hackathons, we'll be having some kind of rewards, each and everything. So that, once I enable it from my end, it will be seen in front of you, where you can go in and participate.

136
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:38.820
Krish Naik: Clear?

137
00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.810
Krish Naik: Everybody clear?

138
00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.340
Krish Naik: Clear enough? Yes?

139
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:53.109
Krish Naik: Okay? And the last section is the most important section, which is called as Community Messages.

140
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.949
Krish Naik: Now, many people, sir, I want to talk to my peer, what they are doing.

141
00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:13.000
Krish Naik: Okay? You go ahead, and in the messages section, you'll be able to find your own community, and you'll be able to go ahead and chat over there. Okay? Unnecessary, do not chat. Hi, how are you? Did you drink tea? Chai pili agya? Don't do all those things, okay?

142
00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:27.830
Krish Naik: Ask related to any class, hey, I'm facing this particular concern, okay? Can somebody help me out over there? Go in and ask those kind of questions. Don't say, hi, how are you? Okay? Good morning, good night, good afternoon, or that WhatsApp forward will come now.

143
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.739
Krish Naik: Send it to 10 people, this will happen, that will happen, don't do that, okay?

144
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.880
Krish Naik: Only chat…

145
00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:44.529
Krish Naik: Something very important, okay? And don't try to make groups over there. Hey, join my WhatsApp group, we will do something amazing, we will fly to Mars. Don't do that.

146
00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.670
Krish Naik: Okay.

147
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:58.500
Krish Naik: The community chat is built in such a purpose that you should be able to… see, guys, you need to respond in the Zoom chat, not here. This is a very good thing, but people are, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, see?

148
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.860
Krish Naik: So this kind of chat you don't do.

149
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.890
Krish Naik: Not useful. You have Zoom chat, go ahead and ping it over there, I've enabled it over there.

150
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.220
Krish Naik: Yeah?

151
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:25.179
Krish Naik: Yeah? No, no, sir, I want to put some kind of must thumbnail, this, kabalt hai. Don't do that, okay? Because here, you're wasting your time. Here, okay, I'm facing this particular concern, can anybody help me out? You'll get some good friends, right?

152
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:43.080
Krish Naik: join the meeting link if you want, but again, I'm telling you, don't give WhatsApp group chat over here, no, no, come, we'll do something amazing, you know? We'll do… you join this particular chat group. Like, many people have done that. If you do that, I will ban you from that particular group also, and I'll not refund your money also.

153
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:53.150
Krish Naik: I'll make sure that to do that, okay? Because I've seen many people, sir, how chat, everybody join this particular chat, and they'll talk something over there.

154
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.360
Krish Naik: Okay, I don't want that particular thing to happen.

155
00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:15.979
Krish Naik: Okay? So this is basically for only important chats, for only important announcement. Hey, today in this particular class, I could not create an environment, can anybody help me out? So you all will have a very good conversation over here. Make sure to have that kind of conversation, so that your learning is very good. See, over here, here.

156
00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:21.609
Krish Naik: If you see on all the other batches, they only share new, new things, what they have built, what they have not built, and all.

157
00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:28.850
Krish Naik: Okay? So, these are the four important sections that is available in your dashboard.

158
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.310
Krish Naik: Good enough?

159
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:35.220
Krish Naik: Yes or no? Do… am I selling you any other course over here? Nothing.

160
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.989
Krish Naik: Nothing. Only Muday Gabat. Like, you have to just come and learn things over here.

161
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.669
Krish Naik: Okay? You just need to come and learn over here. Agree?

162
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.170
Krish Naik: Yes or no?

163
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.999
Krish Naik: Agree or not?

164
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.540
Krish Naik: Yeah? So we are not selling anything over here. Here, for the best.

165
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:06.389
Krish Naik: for your learning what it is, that is actually required. From that, you'll be able to learn things. Okay?

166
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.850
Krish Naik: Perfect. Guys, my voice is very much clear, I have a very good internet connection, please check your internet.

167
00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.450
Monal Kumar: Please check your internet.

168
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:19.280
Krish Naik: Okay? Ha, on the right-hand side, you'll be able to see something called a leaderboard.

169
00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.189
Krish Naik: This leaderboard is based on some metrics, okay?

170
00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:42.629
Krish Naik: How many times you are active in your dashboard? How many hours of content you are able to see every day, you know? How many times you have interacted with your course mats, right? How many times you have seen the video? How many times you have answered the comments? All those things…

171
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:47.650
Krish Naik: Will basically get calculated, and here, you'll be getting a leaderboard.

172
00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.599
Krish Naik: Okay, and based on this particular leaderboard, you'll be assigned this particular ratings.

173
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:59.499
Krish Naik: Now, why this is important, I'll tell you. Why this is important. Sometimes what happens is that

174
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:06.719
Krish Naik: We get requirements from the people, from the companies, for various job roles, you know?

175
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.660
Krish Naik: There are two ways how we approach you all, right? The first way is that we definitely post

176
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:30.719
Krish Naik: Everyone in your community section, along with that, we also give you a mail, saying that, hey, this is what is there, do you want to apply for this? You can go ahead and apply, we'll give you the link, everything. The second thing is, when people do not apply, we try to contact people based on the specific ratings, right?

177
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:41.929
Krish Naik: The reason is very simple, because whoever is more active over here, who is doing more things, will try to contact them, because they will be the most interested people out there for attending those kind of interviews.

178
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.150
Krish Naik: Okay?

179
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:54.870
Krish Naik: Gaurav, everything. This course is… I'll talk more about this particular course, what all things we'll be covering, each and everything, okay? So don't worry. Yeah, the leaderboard will show batch-wise.

180
00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.119
Krish Naik: Okay, it'll be showing batch-wise.

181
00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:02.690
Krish Naik: Okay. Till here, everything is com- clear, everybody?

182
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.330
Krish Naik: Yeah?

183
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:07.750
Krish Naik: Perfect.

184
00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.830
Krish Naik: Now, let me do one thing.

185
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:16.779
Krish Naik: Let me… Start writing something.

186
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.709
Krish Naik: Some do's and don'ts that every people should follow.

187
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:34.569
Krish Naik: Nikita Kulkarni, I hope you have got the counseling team number. Just directly go ahead and check in the website, or in my… any of the posts, you'll be able to see that. Okay?

188
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:40.550
Krish Naik: Okay, guys. So, this is the 2.0 Ultimate Data Science Batch.

189
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.920
Krish Naik: Okay.

190
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.160
Krish Naik: So let me go ahead and write some do's and don'ts.

191
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.009
Krish Naik: Do's and don'ts.

192
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:53.399
Krish Naik: And before writing do's and don'ts, let me talk more about your batch.

193
00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:01.549
Krish Naik: So… Your 2.0 Ultimate Data Science, in a week, will have 3 days classes, right?

194
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.510
Krish Naik: Which all days you have classes?

195
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.440
Krish Naik: Saturday?

196
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.609
Krish Naik: Saturday and Sunday.

197
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.469
Krish Naik: And then… You have? On which days you have?

198
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.470
Krish Naik: Wednesday.

199
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:31.640
Krish Naik: Saturday and Sunday, you have the sessions between 9 AM to…

200
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:37.730
Krish Naik: 1PM IST. We basically say 12PM, but…

201
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.990
Krish Naik: I know it is going to go ahead and… Extended like anything.

202
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.100
Krish Naik: Okay?

203
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:49.670
Krish Naik: Then, Wednesday, Wednesday, what is the timing, Monal?

204
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:57.759
Monal Kumar: Wednesday, actually, we have, mentioned from 9, 8 to 10, 9, but…

205
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.990
Monal Kumar: But we want to make it also flexible, for other classes. At the start, it will be 8.30 to 10.

206
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.760
Krish Naik: 8.30 PM.

207
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:07.900
Monal Kumar: 2?

208
00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.960
Krish Naik: 10.30 p.m. IST.

209
00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.849
Krish Naik: And remember, in Wednesday, we are not going to extend more.

210
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:25.370
Krish Naik: We will try to close it between 10… 8.30 to 10.30. We'll not take much session, but at least we'll try to cover one hour class.

211
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.140
Monal Kumar: Yes.

212
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.370
Krish Naik: And then we'll be having the doubt clearing session. Now, the reason why we are doing this is that

213
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:35.799
Krish Naik: Because, see, from our experience from the 1.0 batch, right?

214
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.889
Krish Naik: Because of just taking two…

215
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:46.169
Krish Naik: Only in the weekends on Saturday and Sunday. We are not able to complete the syllabus, because holidays are coming in between.

216
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:59.519
Krish Naik: Right? Because of this, what has happened is that our batch has got delayed, and I don't want that thing to happen. You know, we want to take that speed of the batch, we want to complete it, and we want to give new things to you all.

217
00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.680
Krish Naik: Okay.

218
00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:13.560
Krish Naik: Wednesday will be difficult for different time zone people. See, that only I'm telling you, Wednesday will be a kind of sessions where… which will not be that important, and that amount of syllabus will not get covered.

219
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.320
Krish Naik: Okay? We really want to keep that one-hour class.

220
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.940
Krish Naik: One to one and a half hour class. It is very, very simple.

221
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:34.130
Krish Naik: And because of this one we have already announced in the batch, like, in your, course, in Krishnak.in website, we have to take this, the reason is very simple, we'll not be able to complete the syllabus.

222
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:50.709
Krish Naik: If you want to complete the syllabus in 12 months, at least we need to go ahead and do this. So Wednesday, I think you need to manage it, but whenever there is a public holiday, we will be doing. See, Wednesday, when we go ahead and take this particular class, till Thursday, your dashboard will have that particular video.

223
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.369
Krish Naik: Right? You can go ahead and take it, take Thursday, Friday, and try to see what all things have been covered, okay?

224
00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:06.770
Krish Naik: Now, whenever the classes gets over, right? Like, let's say this live session is basically getting over, after… within 24 hours.

225
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.060
Krish Naik: Your video will be available.

226
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:16.319
Krish Naik: in the dashboard. Now, you may be thinking, Krish, why not in 2 to 3 hours?

227
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:23.049
Krish Naik: Yeah, in 2-3 hours also, we can do it, okay? If we get the video directly from the Zoom quickly.

228
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:28.130
Krish Naik: Okay? If the video we get directly from the Zoom in that

229
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:45.830
Krish Naik: fast time, we'll be able to upload it. But what happens is that Zoom usually takes time for that particular rendering. So that is the reason we are saying within, within 24 hours, we will go ahead and put the videos in your dashboard, and that will be the recorded videos, okay?

230
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:53.720
Krish Naik: At any point of time, if you have any kind of concern, I will also talk about that, how you can also go ahead and communicate to us, okay?

231
00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.519
Krish Naik: Clear, everyone, for here.

232
00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:03.220
Krish Naik: How much, how many days, how long these recordings will be available? 4,000 days.

233
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:09.480
Krish Naik: For 1000 days, these recordings will be available.

234
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.690
Krish Naik: Okay? Thousand days. Now, the next question, Krish.

235
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.220
Krish Naik: Will you give us certification?

236
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:23.340
Krish Naik: And you know my answer. What should we do this, for this?

237
00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.270
Krish Naik: Okay?

238
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.959
Krish Naik: What should we do this?

239
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.150
Krish Naik: Should I give you certification?

240
00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.490
Krish Naik: Sir, we don't want certificate, okay, good.

241
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.249
Krish Naik: No certification in Krishnak Academy.

242
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:51.420
Krish Naik: No certification in Krishnak Academy. What certificate I'll give you? You are the world's best data scientist, huh?

243
00:45:52.340 --> 00:46:06.359
Krish Naik: written… given a signature by Krishnak, who am I to probably tell you you are the world's best data scientist, okay? It is based on your work. Monal, do you have any certificate? Monal is working for his client, like Apple and all, right?

244
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:12.550
Krish Naik: Did someone ask Munal, hey, are you the world's best data scientist? But he does a lot of tasks in his company.

245
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:25.329
Krish Naik: Yeah. Yeah, but some people may want to reimburse the money from the companies. At that point of time, we will definitely give you a course completion certificate.

246
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:44.960
Krish Naik: You can just contact our team, we'll give a format like that, where we are saying it'll be in a written letter, that you have probably put this much effort, this many number of hours of efforts, and you have completed that. If you want that, you can give me, so that you can submit to the company. No, in the LinkedIn, I want to put the certificate by putting nice,

247
00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.930
Krish Naik: You know, what do we say? Mala and all? I don't want that one.

248
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.970
Krish Naik: Okay.

249
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:57.710
Krish Naik: I don't believe in certification. I believe in the kind of work that you basically do. So, no certification. If somebody's asking me certification, please.

250
00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:12.230
Krish Naik: I'll make you a certification in Canva. You edit, you put your name, you take my signature also, no worries, okay? Nice, I'll give you the edited format online, directly from Canva. Anybody can edit and put their name.

251
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.590
Krish Naik: Okay?

252
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:26.189
Krish Naik: Clear? So, this, no certification from my side. Something I… if I do not support, I'll definitely not give that. Okay? So certification work also is done. Clear?

253
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:33.519
Krish Naik: Okay, now… How many mentors are there, sir? Who all mentors will be there? Okay?

254
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:40.120
Krish Naik: So, for this entire batch, we have identified monol, Chris?

255
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:41.690
Krish Naik: That is myself.

256
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.010
Krish Naik: Sharon Shupal.

257
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.160
Krish Naik: Okay?

258
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:51.509
Krish Naik: And we may bring Sunny or Mank.

259
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.460
Krish Naik: Now, the thing is, sir, who'll take what?

260
00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:01.580
Krish Naik: So, monol will start with… Python.

261
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.660
Krish Naik: stats… Machine learning.

262
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.459
Krish Naik: NLP. NLP means NLP with machine learning, okay?

263
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.870
Krish Naik: Monol is very good at computer vision also.

264
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:20.780
Krish Naik: Okay? But… For computer vision, for deep learning, we'll bring Sharan Shopal.

265
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.809
Krish Naik: So for this, for deep learning part, we'll be bringing Paul.

266
00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:32.920
Krish Naik: Krishnak, that is myself, I will come in.

267
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.230
Krish Naik: Gen AI.

268
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:40.559
Krish Naik: Okay, Gen AI. And then we may bring Sunny for Agentic AI.

269
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.690
Krish Naik: Now, you may be thinking, Krish, no, no, no, I want,

270
00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:51.830
Krish Naik: I want Krisher's entire video. Many people will say that, okay?

271
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:59.310
Krish Naik: Let me tell you one thing, guys. Along with this, We provide… Free!

272
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.239
Krish Naik: Udemy courses, Recorded by Krisher.

273
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.729
Krish Naik: To everyone in this specific batch.

274
00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.250
Krish Naik: Okay.

275
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.270
Krish Naik: In this batch, or in all the live bootcamps, whoever attends.

276
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:26.410
Krish Naik: We give our recordings specifically, okay? Specifically done by me. The reason why I want you all to learn from other mentors also, because these all are mentors who are working in industries.

277
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.260
Krish Naik: We're working with amazing use cases.

278
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:34.799
Krish Naik: My experience of teaching may differ from their experience of teaching.

279
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:41.979
Krish Naik: Right? They may have developed some more additional projects with new techniques, with what I usually develop.

280
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:49.540
Krish Naik: Okay? With what I usually develop. See, let me tell you. One of the problem statements that we are currently working on, right?

281
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.270
Krish Naik: is this.

282
00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.220
Krish Naik: Si.

283
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:02.910
Krish Naik: I'm just showing the staging. So this is the new product that we'll be develop… coming up with soon.

284
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.190
Krish Naik: Industry-ready projects.

285
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:08.460
Krish Naik: Do you see this?

286
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.350
Krish Naik: Is this amazing or not?

287
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:22.269
Krish Naik: see this kind of industry-ready project. We are coming as a product, right? Right now it is in staging, not live, okay? So here you'll be able to see. And here, what we are doing is that.

288
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:31.570
Krish Naik: This will be only an industry-ready project. Whoever is only focused in developing industry-ready projects, they should only be taking this particular product. See this.

289
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:41.050
Krish Naik: Nice, right? And if you just go ahead and see anything, like, let's say if I'm going inside this, do you see this? This is how is the architecture that is developed.

290
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:51.769
Krish Naik: And to probably develop this product, I… I alone have not recorded this. We have so many people involved over here who are from industries.

291
00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:57.809
Krish Naik: Here, we are not focusing on how you are teaching. Here, we are focusing on

292
00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:05.710
Krish Naik: You may be thinking, sir, because the level of teaching over here will be very, very high.

293
00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:19.009
Krish Naik: with the kind of projects that we have actually built. S3 bucket, MongoDB, like, we are talking about MongoDB, we are talking about high-level things, we are talking about high-level architecture. Do you see these architectures?

294
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:25.769
Krish Naik: Do you see this? GitHub, Dockers, registry, AWS ECR, why it is used?

295
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.180
Krish Naik: Right?

296
00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:32.160
Krish Naik: And suddenly, some people will come and say, sir, I don't know how to create an environment.

297
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.899
Krish Naik: Now, what we should say with that?

298
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.220
Krish Naik: Sir, your mentor did not teach me how to create an environment.

299
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:44.689
Krish Naik: Right? So we want to bring up the best kind of experience for you, so that you learn in a way that

300
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:54.470
Krish Naik: You are able to understand things, right? So that's the reason we are bringing this kind of team, who are working together, and who are creating this specific impact.

301
00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:00.779
Krish Naik: Agree, everyone? See, you go and see any projects, like, right now you'll not be able to see.

302
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:02.790
Krish Naik: See the architecture.

303
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.120
Krish Naik: See the architecture.

304
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.510
Krish Naik: Right?

305
00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:15.589
Krish Naik: isn't just amazing? If you see prerequisites, prerequisites, basic Python, familiarity, GitHub account.

306
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:31.330
Krish Naik: Curriculum, see, this is the curriculum, right? Interviews, project interviews also we are bringing up, okay? So this is the product that we are building, and it will be live on 22nd. And we are working on this. See, object detection with faster RCNN. See, over here, the architecture you see.

307
00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.310
Krish Naik: Good, right?

308
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:44.069
Krish Naik: Now, this project also you'll be able to understand once you are very thorough with the basics of learning that we are actually doing in our batch.

309
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.270
Krish Naik: Agree?

310
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:54.510
Krish Naik: Okay? So this is what is the kind of thing, so that is the reason I'm focusing on multiple mentors who give… gives you best industry experience.

311
00:52:54.940 --> 00:53:03.049
Krish Naik: Because 12 months batch is impossible just by one mentor to probably take. Both of you will become mad, student and mentor.

312
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:15.660
Krish Naik: Okay? No, no, product… the industry-ready project is a separate product, guys. We cannot include everything in such a small price. Try to understand. I think,

313
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:24.779
Krish Naik: Guys, how many, how many places you have seen that, what you pay for the product, you know, let's say live bootcamp, 12 months.

314
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:30.890
Krish Naik: In the internet, what price do you see, and what price do you see in our… in our, platform?

315
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:37.010
Krish Naik: Do you agree that we are selling so that we want to really teach people, right?

316
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:48.529
Krish Naik: Right? It's just like mentors like Monel, mentors like Sunny and all are there, who are trying to help and who are coming up with a common vision, right?

317
00:53:49.100 --> 00:54:07.719
Krish Naik: That's the reason we are working together. We don't want to charge very high, because we believe that, okay, that much is not required. Yes, we want to make some profits so that we build things like this, like industry-ready projects. We bring more people who think like us, right? That's the reason we try to do that.

318
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:13.999
Krish Naik: Okay, but definitely, if… again, people say… in this also, people will say, sir, please provide some discount.

319
00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:29.769
Krish Naik: Okay? There, also, we try to help them out, okay? That's the main thing about our site, right? If you go ahead and see Gen AI, GenTK, I know, right now, people are, like, putting lakhs and lakhs of rupees in this. I've seen multiple platforms, and when I see the content.

320
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:32.700
Krish Naik: Internally, I feel very sad.

321
00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:33.710
Krish Naik: Okay.

322
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:40.129
Krish Naik: Because that kind of content, is far… again, I don't want to put more points in that, but…

323
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:55.440
Krish Naik: Just in this only, no? And in this batch, we are going to include everything from RAG to Gen AI to Agentic AI, to… we will cover multiple frameworks, we'll do multiple things and all, right? So that… that is the thing that we really want to bring. We want people to learn.

324
00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:02.290
Krish Naik: We want people to learn in such a way that they create impact in their companies, they do amazing work. That's the reason we are doing this, okay?

325
00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:10.740
Krish Naik: Clear? So, all these things are there, we have also answered about certification, we have answered… These free Udemy courses.

326
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:18.410
Krish Naik: Once in every classes, this class I will not give, because I know in induction session, everybody will come.

327
00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.979
Krish Naik: From next, session…

328
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:30.759
Krish Naik: Because I've seen, you know, initially people will join, then people, attendance will start reducing. So when people's attendance will start reducing, that time I'll share.

329
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:32.670
Krish Naik: I want you all to…

330
00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:51.909
Krish Naik: I want you all to come and join the batch. There are thousand plus students, don't worry about the students, there are not thousand plus students also, right? Over here, right now. Okay, I can see the number directly on my eyes, okay? People are worried about that, sir, how many bache hai? Kese answer karoge.

331
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:53.790
Krish Naik: Okay.

332
00:55:55.530 --> 00:56:12.010
Krish Naik: Okay? We never give any kind of complaints, yeah? Some people will be there. That, even their parents and God can't help them. What… how can we help them? Okay? They're bringing all the frust… some people will come with a lot of frustration.

333
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.980
Krish Naik: Yeah, a lot of frustration, huh? It's our…

334
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:31.360
Krish Naik: Mirko, I have just attended his induction session, tomorrow only you'll make me a data scientist. It'll not be possible like that. Okay? So please, be patient, okay? Every time, and every month, we'll also keep some kind of hackathons, some kind of task.

335
00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.540
Krish Naik: And there will be some rewards. And if you do well, you may also get hired

336
00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.910
Krish Naik: In our company itself.

337
00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:44.360
Krish Naik: In Krishnak Academy, where we are building products and all, right? You'll be hired over there. Okay?

338
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:55.029
Krish Naik: Okay, huh. Usually, whenever the class happens, let's say from 9am to 12pm, right? And after this, we start our doubt clearing session.

339
00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:01.700
Krish Naik: In the doubt clearing session, what we do is that… We, first of all.

340
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:17.099
Krish Naik: Allow people to raise their hand. Not now. In the doubt clearing, okay? When people raise their hand, we unmute them, and we allow to talk them, we… if they want to share the screen, they can share the screen, and we'll try to answer them also. Okay?

341
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:21.550
Krish Naik: But, over here, Over here, you have to wait.

342
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:40.329
Krish Naik: Okay? You have to wait. See, the thing is that, if you want to provide the best experience, we need to talk with everyone. Everybody wants to talk, right? So there will be a long list of line people waiting, right? They'll be raising their hands, one person will be asking that out, it may go to 2 to 3 minutes.

343
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:44.540
Krish Naik: And we have also seen, like, if 100 people have the doubt, right?

344
00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:49.249
Krish Naik: Everybody will… more than 50% of the doubts will be common.

345
00:57:51.830 --> 00:58:02.439
Krish Naik: More than 50% of the doubts will be common, so please listen to every other doubts also. I know you may get frustrated, you need to wait for some time. Please…

346
00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:09.369
Krish Naik: Just be with that frustration for some days, because after some days, that all will get reduced.

347
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:24.019
Krish Naik: Okay? And people, when you hear this 50% of the common doubts, your query will be resolved. Then also, there will be many people we want to talk to Krista, we want to talk to Monalsa, just for our satisfaction. Just wait, okay? And…

348
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:49.880
Krish Naik: In this doubt clearing, we want to, first of all, give preference to other people who are from countries who are joining at late night or early mornings, okay? So please also take care for that particular time span, because we will be giving them preferences first, okay? Like, US people will be there, they will be coming up late night or early in the morning, so we'll clear the doubts very much quickly, so that they can go ahead and do this. That is basic humanity.

349
00:58:49.880 --> 00:59:12.679
Krish Naik: Guys, we cannot enforce someone to be staying at night, because they also do not have any other option, right? People who are learning from there, they're learning for some reason, right? They may be from other countries, because of cost factor, because of other things. So let's be together. At the end of the day, we are one kind of family, right? We want to learn in a way that everybody achieves some kind of goal, right?

350
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:29.819
Krish Naik: So please try to do in that particular way. Be thoughtful, be kind to each other, right? If one person is learning, one person is getting the doubt cleared, be happy for them, right? Similarly, your doubts will also get cleared. But, unless and until all your doubts are not cleared, we will not close the session.

351
00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:39.150
Krish Naik: That, I will compulsory, give you a, you know, foolproof answer for that. Whatever doubts is there, please wait. We will answer everybody's doubt over there.

352
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:40.230
Krish Naik: Okay?

353
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.470
Krish Naik: Clear?

354
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:45.640
Krish Naik: I think everything is covered, Mona, anything that is remaining?

355
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.890
Monal Kumar: No, sir, everything is clear.

356
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.290
Krish Naik: Yay.

357
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:55.910
Krish Naik: -

358
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:58.160
Krish Naik: Okay, perfect.

359
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.549
Krish Naik: Do's and don'ts. Okay.

360
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.809
Krish Naik: Do's and don'ts.

361
01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.569
Krish Naik: The first thing.

362
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:11.719
Krish Naik: Whenever the mentor is teaching, Just focus on the screen.

363
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.809
Krish Naik: Focus on the screen.

364
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:19.190
Krish Naik: In between, you may have queries.

365
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.550
Krish Naik: Please wait.

366
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:27.559
Krish Naik: When mentor is teaching for 20 minutes, then he'll ask, do you have any queries? If many people say, no queries.

367
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:46.180
Krish Naik: then he will continue. If many people say, yes, there is a query, you need to make us understand this topic again, then the mentor will again explain it. Okay? If some of the people are there, no, sir, we are not able to understand. Some people, many people says yes, will continue. But in the doubt clearing, we'll again clarify those. Okay?

368
01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:55.609
Krish Naik: Okay, one more thing, huh, and one more thing. With respect to do's and don'ts, right? In between, nobody's going to unmute you.

369
01:00:55.930 --> 01:01:03.099
Krish Naik: So please make sure that nobody… just focus on the screen, focus on your learning itself. That is very much required.

370
01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.600
Krish Naik: Now, if you go to the dashboard.

371
01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:21.280
Krish Naik: Do you see this, resources section, right? So, after every module or every class that is uploaded in the resources section, you'll be able to see the resources also, and materials also. Okay? The mentor will keep on sharing.

372
01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.370
Krish Naik: Clear?

373
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:29.039
Krish Naik: Perfect, I think, we're good, now, what I will do…

374
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.670
Krish Naik: I think we can start taking that out, Gang, right?

375
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:38.030
Krish Naik: Yes. Mona? Yes.

376
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:39.180
Monal Kumar: Yes, sure, sir.

377
01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:47.999
Krish Naik: Okay. Monal, you just unmute one person, and, at a time, wait, I'll first of all give you the host access.

378
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.990
Monal Kumar: Yes.

379
01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:51.880
Krish Naik: Okay.

380
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:53.550
Monal Kumar: Alright, yes.

381
01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:00.809
Monal Kumar: Alright, so… Jagiraju? Ajog Raju? Yes.

382
01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:03.460
JOGIraju: Hi, Chris. Hello.

383
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:15.830
JOGIraju: Thanks for class. So, actually, basically, I'm just working in, MNC company. We started to use the RAG kind of model to build the projects in this current month.

384
01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:17.630
JOGIraju: Next one.

385
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:27.459
JOGIraju: So, I joined this course, I have a good and basic understanding of RAG model, how to implement, what to implement, and everything.

386
01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:33.889
Monal Kumar: So, this class will teach from basics to, rag model also, we'll be covering in this particular part, right? Yes.

387
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:41.549
JOGIraju: Yes, yes. So, it will take some time to get the track and other things to happen in this class.

388
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:42.179
Monal Kumar: Yep, yep.

389
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:56.979
JOGIraju: Yeah. So, is there any way that, there is another RAG courses going on parallelly, right? So, is that, some kind of, things we can go ahead there, we need to purchase it?

390
01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:03.879
JOGIraju: Or such kind of, Krishna had told us there are some kind of UDME courses which he already developed.

391
01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:28.120
JOGIraju: So, we can get that kind of stuff, so that in parallel, because we are not… we are experienced people, so we cannot wait, till so long time. So, if there is any parallel kind of approach, or, we need to purchase a thing, or we'll get a good kind of stuff for material in ODMI, or some kind, right? If we can share it early, or next, ask Chris, tell…

392
01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:30.880
JOGIraju: Told not in this particular step.

393
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.940
Krish Naik: Next week in class, I'll share it.

394
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:42.209
JOGIraju: Next or next week, so that we will be in touch with the standards of our organization, and the same with the current environment, whatever we have.

395
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.450
Krish Naik: Yes, yes. Next weekend, so… okay?

396
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:50.120
Krish Naik: Okay, there is also one more thing, right? We run something called as AI Pro, okay?

397
01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.500
JOGIraju: Okay. In AIPro, there is a plan.

398
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:59.600
Krish Naik: Where, like, let's say, there is some price for that, okay? If you have joined 2.0 Ultimate Data Science.

399
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:00.400
JOGIraju: Yeah.

400
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.000
Krish Naik: 2.2 Ultimate Data Science minus price, remaining what is there, you give it, and you get access to all the batches.

401
01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:08.530
JOGIraju: For a yearly subscription basis.

402
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.640
JOGIraju: Okay, okay.

403
01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:19.909
Monal Kumar: So whether it is RAG, whether it is Agentic AI, whether it is any kind of batch, you can go ahead and access it, okay? But again, with all these things, Udemy will definitely come for free.

404
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.950
Krish Naik: I'm telling you.

405
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:28.840
JOGIraju: Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Only that because in middle, we need to develop the projects, we cannot wait till last minute.

406
01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.600
Krish Naik: Agree, agree.

407
01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:46.899
JOGIraju: Yeah, so that kind, if you can… because, you, you're amazing that I never went into this type of courses, but yeah, after seeing your YouTube video for a few things, I just joined it with no… with no one coordination or contact.

408
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:55.249
JOGIraju: So, just I want to explore on the more, updated, industry updates and everything I just want to learn, so that, again…

409
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:59.349
Krish Naik: Like, parallelly, right now at 9 o'clock, another rack batch is going on.

410
01:04:59.350 --> 01:04:59.760
JOGIraju: Yeah.

411
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:10.190
Krish Naik: of that. And there, we are teaching everybody, rack from basics and scratch, you know? So, just have a look, like, talk to the counseling team, they'll help you out with this, okay?

412
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:11.450
JOGIraju: Thank you, thank you very much.

413
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:12.240
Krish Naik: Yeah, I couldn't.

414
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.969
Monal Kumar: Thank you very much. Yes. All right, so we have Ravi next. Hey, Ravi.

415
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.810
Ravi USA: Yeah.

416
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:41.840
Ravi USA: Hi, Molan. Hi, Krish. So, I have a couple of questions. So, first thing, like, like, if we are focused on agentic AI or becoming an AI engineer, or an AI architect, generative AI, so how much of this, this concept related to, to machine learning and, related to deep learning, or

417
01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.570
Ravi USA: How much of the, like, or the supervised learning, all these models that you teach.

418
01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:55.109
Ravi USA: Like, how much are they required for a generative AI engineer? And how much can we… does it not require?

419
01:05:55.110 --> 01:06:08.180
Monal Kumar: Understood, sure, sure. I will tell you. Okay, so if I talk about current market, we do have very few positions, but that is not going to be the case in future, that is Agentic AI Engineer. For me, personally.

420
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:27.620
Monal Kumar: there is a big, importance for AI engineer, okay? Agentic AI engineer, let's remove that tag from the job profile. There is something called as AI Engineer, which is on the top of AI, alright? That person should know everything. So, AI engineer, in 2026,

421
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:46.429
Monal Kumar: are expected to know agentic AI. It also means that that engineer tomorrow… because you are working… you're going to work with multiple clients, right? But tomorrow, you have a data requirement, and there you require a machine learning also. Then what you will do, you cannot say to a client or a company that I don't know machine learning or deep learning. I only know agentic AI.

422
01:06:46.940 --> 01:07:04.730
Monal Kumar: Are you able to understand? So, if you are restricting yourself only for agentic and RAG, you will not be able to solve the problem of data science. Guys, this is about problem statement, it is not about tech. If you want to excel in your career, you have to be engineer, and engineer solves everything.

423
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:10.320
Monal Kumar: You cannot just restrict yourself that I only know agentic AI, and that's all.

424
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:15.339
Monal Kumar: No, that's not how industry works. Tomorrow, you run some X project, which only requires agentic.

425
01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:25.440
Monal Kumar: it might be possible that the next project is for deep learning, where you're only going to work with computer vision. Then what you will do? No, sir, I don't know computer vision. You cannot say this to a company or your…

426
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:36.740
Monal Kumar: company, right? You cannot say this to a team or company that I don't know certain things. So, if you have a capability of, engineer, you have skill set of an engineer in 2026,

427
01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.980
Monal Kumar: Then, you will be able to solve anything.

428
01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.689
Monal Kumar: So, does this answer your question, Ravi?

429
01:07:41.690 --> 01:08:06.689
Ravi USA: Yes, yeah, I also want to, like, ask about, see, this is my understanding, maybe I could be wrong, we can type that. See, for agentic AI or AI engineer, let's say they are talking about fine-tuning, they talk about some more specialized things which are not in the skill set of a traditional machine learning engineer. So, like, the focus of this batch is everything, or, like, even

430
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:16.570
Ravi USA: the fine-tuning, or even the cloud deployment, and even the scaling and everything, or the focus is, like, a generic AI and ML engineer?

431
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:38.599
Monal Kumar: No, focus is on gen… Focus is on how to become an AI engineer. That's what our focus is. But if you want to be more specialized, that is, AI engineer who knows fine-tuning of LLMs, that is a specialization that we also provide, but that specialization we cannot cover. Otherwise, that will be 6 months. But… and we're also talking about load balancing and other things, those are a part of MLOps, LLMOps.

432
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:45.379
Monal Kumar: So, a generic AI engineer, but a great machine learning engineer, deep learning engineer, is what you're going to get.

433
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.270
Monal Kumar: It's thought you are going to be here.

434
01:08:48.120 --> 01:09:09.150
Monal Kumar: So, machine learning, deep learning, AI, gen AI, all those parts you're going to cover, but if you want to be very specific that, sir, I want to create a computer vision model, like generative models, right? I want to train my own transformer and create some large language model, then that is a specialization of Gen AI that you have to go inside.

435
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:22.399
Monal Kumar: what is LLM, how to train LLMs, what are LLMs, how to create a project out of it, how to be industry-ready, so you, if tomorrow you have an interview, once this course is completed, right, you will be able to clear that is what this level is going to bring you.

436
01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:23.569
Monal Kumar: All right?

437
01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:48.939
Ravi USA: Yeah, yeah, thank you. And one more thing, I think a request for Krishna, right? So, I'm in the AI Pro plan, actually, like, but, actually, I just recently started this, like, three… one month ago, but this course started now. Like, the problem with the AI Pro plan is it will expire, like, within 365 days, and I'm a bit scared that I will lose the access to everything, including this patch, because

438
01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:52.340
Ravi USA: I am following this. Like, is it possible if you have an AI program.

439
01:09:52.340 --> 01:10:00.750
Krish Naik: See, again, I'll tell you, Rami, the main thing is, no, this one year is also more than sufficient sometimes. It is, like, how regularly you are studying.

440
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:07.049
Krish Naik: Okay? The reason why we have kept one-year subscription, we did not increase it, because there are many changes that are happening.

441
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.790
Krish Naik: Okay.

442
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:08.260
Monal Kumar: Yes.

443
01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:12.360
Krish Naik: So, many changes when they are happening, no? We are going to repeat this batch again and again.

444
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:13.470
Monal Kumar: It'll be.

445
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:28.070
Krish Naik: Like, once in a year, we are launching this batch, but other batches will repeat it. The reason is the frequent changes are basically coming in the libraries, okay? But I'll just talk to my team whether I can increase from 1 year to 1.5 years, that I'll check, okay?

446
01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:33.039
Ravi USA: Yeah, like, something like recorded sessions, I mean, not for all the batches, all the batches.

447
01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.959
Krish Naik: Currently, I'm telling you, all the Udemy courses I'm providing in the form of recordings to you.

448
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.930
Ravi USA: Okay, at anybody.

449
01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:41.139
Krish Naik: Udemy is for a lifetime, okay? That is free for you all.

450
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:48.280
Ravi USA: Okay, yeah, thank you, Krish. Like, I just don't want to miss the continuity, that's the reason why I'm just asking. Gotcha, gotcha.

451
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.260
Krish Naik: Thank you.

452
01:10:50.830 --> 01:11:02.700
Monal Kumar: Alright, so there is one chat that, guys, you can get AI Pro anytime, in between course, after course, right now as well, so it's totally up to you, just contact our team, and they will be able to help you on that.

453
01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:11.140
Krish Naik: Wait, wait, I'll just send you the team number so that you can just talk to them at any point of time, Sean or Darius, it is up to you.

454
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:22.730
Krish Naik: But, again, sometimes over-commitment, don't over-commit yourself, start with a basic, then if you are… if you are… if you are good enough, then go ahead.

455
01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:23.370
Monal Kumar: Yes.

456
01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.320
Krish Naik: So you can call this number, everyone, okay?

457
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:30.589
Krish Naik: I've provided the number also.

458
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.670
Krish Naik: Yep.

459
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:37.370
Krish Naik: Ishan is our counseling team, so yeah, continue, Mona. Allow.

460
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:40.320
Monal Kumar: Alright, so next we have a Thanodry.

461
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:47.579
Monal Kumar: Yes, yeah, not able to hear you.

462
01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:49.799
Atanu Roy: Am I audible this time?

463
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.069
Monal Kumar: You're audible, you're audible. Hello, how are you?

464
01:11:52.070 --> 01:12:05.730
Atanu Roy: Thank you. Yeah, I am doing good. So, just I have a basic question. Actually, honestly, we… I am eager to learn being a novice, okay? Like, I have just basic understanding of Python.

465
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:18.050
Atanu Roy: honest confession, sir, like, I don't have much understanding of AI, but I want to transition. So, like, I definitely look forward to this course and commit myself to

466
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:29.580
Atanu Roy: brush and take up these things. Just wanted to know, like, whenever the sessions are going on, like, whatever projects we would be building, or whatever practice we would be doing.

467
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:43.289
Atanu Roy: like, any kind of hardware specifications that we need in our personal laptops, or we would be getting some online cloud-based simulator kind of things.

468
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:44.610
Monal Kumar: Share the time.

469
01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:53.520
Monal Kumar: Okay. So, first of all, I want to answer your first question that, you want to learn as a… from the novice level, right?

470
01:12:53.650 --> 01:13:09.530
Monal Kumar: And trust me that this course has no prerequisite. If there is some prerequisite, I'm also going to cover even from the computer science background point of view. Not just data science, but I will also cover from the computer science day point of view, if that requires in the course. If, because

471
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:24.699
Monal Kumar: How we teach is, we don't teach just from the syllabus. Syllabus is there, guys. Syllabus, everything we're going to complete. But if you guys require something that you're not able to understand, it might be possible 20% of people does not know something. Then we will also tease that so that we will be able to complete the syllabus.

472
01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:35.399
Monal Kumar: Alright? So it's not like we… whatever is there, we are going to escape it, or we are not going to add anything. It totally depends on the badge how people are. Alright? Does this answer your questions? First question?

473
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:35.830
Monal Kumar: Yes.

474
01:13:35.830 --> 01:14:00.140
Monal Kumar: Alright? Second is, from the hardware perspective, don't worry about it. We will be showing you multiple methods, you just need to have a basic laptop. I'm not seeing i5, i7. I will share one post where I've written all of these things, based on your budget. If you already have a laptop, don't worry about it. If you… if it requires later in the stage, maybe after this course, you want… you think that, now I want to go into the specialization and build more things.

475
01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:14.279
Monal Kumar: Again, there are more ways in cloud where you can subscribe and do… learn all of those things, practice all of those things, but for now, it is not required. Maybe later, you can also ask the same question, and I will be able to help you. But, don't worry about it now.

476
01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:22.429
Atanu Roy: Yeah, yeah. Just, I was worried, like, if things comes up all of a sudden, then, I mean, better planning should be done, that's it.

477
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:31.219
Monal Kumar: If you're able to… if you're able to run Google Chrome with 10 tabs, 20 tabs, then probably you will be able to, learn from this course, alright?

478
01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:38.600
Monal Kumar: At least at the initial part of it. But later part, we will show you Colab and a lot of amazing things, which is already free, of course, alright?

479
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.729
Atanu Roy: Yeah, yeah, shit.

480
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:40.700
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, thanks.

481
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.510
Atanu Roy: Thank you.

482
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:44.310
Monal Kumar: Yes, next we have Surya. Surya?

483
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:53.179
Monal Kumar: And guys, whoever is done, please unraise your hand, so that we can see clearly here, alright? Yeah, Surya, you're next.

484
01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.279
Monal Kumar: Julia? Are you there? Alright, in the meantime, Deepak, you're next.

485
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.050
Monal Kumar: Deepbook?

486
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:22.359
Deepak: Thanks, Chris, sir. Thanks, Mono, for giving me an opportunity to talk. So, basically, what I wanted to check on a few things. I am posting some question on a chart. Yes. So, will all be addressed, or some… something which is very important will be get addressed?

487
01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:35.830
Monal Kumar: No, no, no, it's not like that. See, a lot of the times, what we have seen that, because we have a lot of people, if someone… if someone pings in the chat section, right, what happens is that the chat gets scrolled on top, and we are not able to see in our current sprint.

488
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:47.999
Monal Kumar: So, from your side, what I am requesting, what we are requesting is that, again, copy and paste the same thing, so that until and unless that query is cleared. But what we are saying from our side is that every query will get cleared.

489
01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Monal Kumar: Alright? But because of the technical things, because the things get scrolled up, we will not be able to see, but everything will be answered in the chat section, or at the end of the class, we will raise the hand, just like this one, and I will be answering your question.

490
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:19.639
Deepak: Thank you, thank you so much. So, basically, transition into the AI field, so I, I came up with a lot of, doubts there, but only with the name of the Chris, sir, which I have heard into the industry most… most of the time, so that's why I enrolled with this. So, coming from the…

491
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:28.839
Deepak: QA background, moving to the, AI field, how will this transition will get happened? So, what, what all help…

492
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:41.380
Monal Kumar: We will make it happen. We will help you, you will make it happen, and don't worry. See, here, when you learn from us, we just… we don't just teach you to become a data scientist, we teach you to become engineer.

493
01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:48.030
Monal Kumar: And if you're an engineer in this field, you develop something, you build something, and if you're able to do that, you can transition.

494
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.090
Monal Kumar: That's what we do, actually.

495
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:51.540
Deepak: Alright?

496
01:16:51.540 --> 01:17:03.470
Monal Kumar: Don't just focus on exact job role, just keep learning from us, keep building, keep doing whatever the assignments and everything, and you will be able to achieve what you want.

497
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:16.119
Monal Kumar: Your goals might change also in the minute of the course, so don't worry about it, but this is for everyone, guys. Everyone will be able to go where they… everyone will be able to achieve their goals.

498
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:20.289
Monal Kumar: But you just need to work on yourself, alright? This is what we will say.

499
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.600
Monal Kumar: Everything is possible, yeah.

500
01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:34.539
Deepak: Okay, so basically, if I want to, connect with one-to-one with you, or Chrysler, or anyone, so, can we do it here, or we, in a loud section, or…

501
01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:57.140
Monal Kumar: This is the main channel where it will happen, okay? This is the main channel where it will happen, and also in the community, see, there are a lot of people in the community who is already in the data field, but they want to learn more advanced things. So what they will do, what you will do, you will, raise a question there, okay? You will ask a question there, other people might be able to help you. And I have seen people… I personally know people who have transitioned from HR

502
01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:21.820
Monal Kumar: Alright? And one-to-one is something… currently, we are one-to-many, alright? So, yes, so this is how we will be doing it, mostly, but if you have a pretty serious concern that tomorrow you have an interview, and you want to ask something, you can literally ping me in LinkedIn, and I will be answering your query. I personally help a lot of people who have this last-minute question for the interview, for everything. So, guys, we will help you.

503
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:28.770
Deepak: Okay, so it would be helpful if we get all the LinkedIn IDs of you, whatever.

504
01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:41.279
Monal Kumar: I will provide, but in the syllabus also, you will see there is a link of all the mentors in the LinkedIn. If you click it, you will be redirected to the LinkedIn page, because a lot of the mentors are not available in this session, but in the syllabus, everything is there, alright?

505
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.220
Deepak: Okay, okay, thank you so much, thank you, Lord.

506
01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.560
Monal Kumar: Thanks, Deepak. Thank you. Yes, Surya, you are next.

507
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:56.749
Monal Kumar: Gloria, are you there? And guys, whoever a query is done, please unraise your hand so that we can see clearly.

508
01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:12.559
Monal Kumar: Guys, if you have doubt… currently, we are focusing on doubt. This is what… the introduction session is just about how you're going to process all of these, places, different tabs, different sections of our things. And if you're clear, and if you don't have doubt.

509
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:23.919
Monal Kumar: You can stay, or you can enjoy your weekend, but yes, Wednesday, guys, we'll be starting… we'll be starting with, whoever is staying till now. Wednesday, we'll be starting the installation.

510
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:28.679
Monal Kumar: And, you will see… you will get the meeting links also, with that time.

511
01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.670
Monal Kumar: Alright?

512
01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.479
Monal Kumar: Yes, okay. Next is… Deva?

513
01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:37.960
DevaChamanchi: Hey.

514
01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.589
Monal Kumar: Deva? Hello, Paige.

515
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:51.230
DevaChamanchi: Yeah, I just wanted to know, I heard, like, there are multiple parts of learning, right? One is traditional way of starting with the, data science, Python and data science.

516
01:19:51.720 --> 01:20:06.460
DevaChamanchi: And, I think I saw somewhere the flow diagram, where you can start with the traditional way, or you can directly jump on and go with the modern way of starting with the, GenAI rag and ATK.

517
01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:07.450
Monal Kumar: Yes.

518
01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:11.589
DevaChamanchi: So, how would… how is that… when… when do we…

519
01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:20.289
Monal Kumar: Alright, alright, okay. Okay, I think the best thing to show you, okay, let me just show you this.

520
01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:22.099
Monal Kumar: Just give me a second, alright?

521
01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:22.960
DevaChamanchi: Sure.

522
01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:33.029
Monal Kumar: Give me a second… Alright, let me share my screen, and then this will, help you

523
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:37.800
Monal Kumar: Help answer everyone. I hope everyone is able to see my screen. Others, guys.

524
01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:41.210
DevaChamanchi: Yep.

525
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:53.050
Monal Kumar: Alright, so guys, this is the roadmap which I have created. You can see this on my LinkedIn as well, and here you can see that it also applies to 2026 as well. Here you can see Agentic AI Engineer.

526
01:20:53.250 --> 01:21:16.829
Monal Kumar: Alright? So you can literally go to agentic AI Engineer, and you can see that here we need to know agents and rack, which is not a traditional machine learning. You can see machine learning is also great here. It means it is not a requirement. But you should know how to communicate with LLMs, that is prompt engineering, you should know Python, you should have a little bit of software engineering. So here, machine learning is not required.

527
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:21.340
Monal Kumar: You can choose any of the specialization. You can also remove the JNEI component also.

528
01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:31.730
Monal Kumar: But if you want to focus on agents and regs, you can become an engineer, but this is a minimum requirement. But whoever wants to excel in their career, do you want minimum requirements, guys?

529
01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.870
Monal Kumar: Sir, you're not audible.

530
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:36.269
Krish Naik: Am I audible now?

531
01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:39.099
Krish Naik: Munel, I've given you the link, just seen the.

532
01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.159
Monal Kumar: Alright. Yes, yes, yes.

533
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.370
Monal Kumar: Alright, yes.

534
01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:52.160
Krish Naik: Go down, this you can show. Wait, wait, wait, go up, go up, go up, go up, go up, yeah, this one, yeah, this one you can show.

535
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:57.959
Monal Kumar: All right, yes. Okay, yes, everyone is able to see this also. This is from Krishna, okay?

536
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:20.570
Monal Kumar: So, based on your… this is the advanced route, modern route, traditional route, this is the traditional route, alright? In the modern route, you can see generative AI you can learn, you can master generative AI, you can add Agent TKI and become generative AI engineer, alright? There are different, different paths to it. So, here, you can see that it does not require your machine learning, it does not require your deep learning, alright? But you can also go to this vein.

537
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:22.650
Monal Kumar: But, as I'm saying, that…

538
01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:31.869
Monal Kumar: Guys, in industry, do you want to become, do you want to excel, or do you want to just become the basic or the ideal version of it?

539
01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:39.779
Monal Kumar: Tell me, do you want to become the minimum requirement, or do you want to be an advanced user of all of these things? Tell me in the chat.

540
01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:46.069
Monal Kumar: excel in industry, alright? So, for someone who wants to… this is…

541
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:49.520
DevaChamanchi: Sorry to cut you, Monol, can I say something here?

542
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:53.340
Monal Kumar: okay, yes, you can see?

543
01:22:53.750 --> 01:23:03.380
DevaChamanchi: Yeah, no, the point I wanted to understand is, as part of this course, do we have multiple options to choose, or are we going to…

544
01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:17.019
Krish Naik: No, they were, they were, see, I will tell you, okay? See, this course is about traditional route, okay? Yes. Like, how we will be covering things in the traditional route. Now, the question is that, do we have any modern route and all also?

545
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:31.689
Krish Naik: Okay, do we also go ahead with modern route, or do we teach this advanced route also? Yes, we have parallel batches, where we teach modern route and advanced route also. Okay? So, for all these three categories, we do take sessions with respect to this.

546
01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:37.700
Krish Naik: Now, for 2.0 Ultimate Data Science, we are only going to follow the traditional route.

547
01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:44.749
Krish Naik: But, if you want to also want to quickly go to the modern route, that is the reason why I said that we will be providing recorded videos.

548
01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:47.859
DevaChamanchi: Yeah, got it correctly. Thank you, Chris.

549
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.269
Krish Naik: recorded videos in Udemy.

550
01:23:50.390 --> 01:24:02.069
Krish Naik: Live session recorded videos is also provided till Deep Learning. So, this LearnDS fundamental is ready, okay? Now, next month, we are coming up with this Modern Route Batch.

551
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:11.989
Krish Naik: specific batch, where we are going to start with generative AI, mastering generative AI, adding agentic AI. This is the next month, we are coming up, and this is a separate batch altogether.

552
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:27.889
Krish Naik: Okay? So, what we are doing is that we are trying to create 3 pipelines with respect to this particular track, okay? That's the reason why I'm saying that people who are interested to quickly go in any of the tracks, they can go ahead and prefer the AI Pro batch. Agree?

553
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:28.640
DevaChamanchi: Agreed.

554
01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:31.609
Krish Naik: Yeah, so that… that is what I was trying to, actually.

555
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.980
DevaChamanchi: Thank you.

556
01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.439
Krish Naik: teleport, yeah?

557
01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:34.330
DevaChamanchi: Right.

558
01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:35.740
Monal Kumar: Right?

559
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:39.770
Monal Kumar: Alright, so Krisha cleared our doubt. I hope everyone is clear.

560
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:42.410
DevaChamanchi: Take a.

561
01:24:42.690 --> 01:24:44.030
Monal Kumar: Yes, thank you.

562
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:49.369
Monal Kumar: Alright, next we have Umang. Umang, you are next.

563
01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.040
Monal Kumar: Hello?

564
01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.139
Monal Kumar: Among your voice is very low.

565
01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:58.670
umang: Hello, am I audible now?

566
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:02.280
Monal Kumar: Yes, it is better. Yes. What is the query?

567
01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:09.829
umang: Yes, I had a concern relating to projects. Will any of the projects will be covered in this.

568
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:14.120
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, we cover projects. Without projects, we cannot complete the course.

569
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:15.439
Monal Kumar: Alright, leave it.

570
01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:22.310
umang: And it's, we do understand the concept, but sometimes we are not able to apply it in projects.

571
01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:26.260
Monal Kumar: Don't worry, don't worry, you will never fix this issue, alright?

572
01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:35.569
Monal Kumar: As I mentioned, our target is not to teach you, our target is to make you an engineer. And trust me, when you're an engineer, you can build things. You will be able to do it alone.

573
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.950
Monal Kumar: Alright?

574
01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.660
Monal Kumar: Anything else, Meng?

575
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:40.090
umang: No, no.

576
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:41.940
Monal Kumar: Alright, that's great.

577
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.470
Monal Kumar: Okay, Surya?

578
01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.090
Monal Kumar: What is the query?

579
01:25:50.690 --> 01:25:53.370
Monal Kumar: Surya, we still can't hear you.

580
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:55.390
Monal Kumar: Something is wrong with your mic.

581
01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:02.429
Monal Kumar: Alright, guys, serious knowledge, something happened with… It's like, okay, Shiva.

582
01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:06.929
Monal Kumar: Tibra Subarmanyan. Yes, you're next.

583
01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.000
Monal Kumar: Female.

584
01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:15.250
Siva Subramanian: Hello?

585
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.120
Monal Kumar: Yes.

586
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:17.750
Monal Kumar: We can hear you.

587
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:33.319
Siva Subramanian: Yes, Modal. I have a doubt, regarding that, I was a BPO background, working in 24 Basin project. Saturdays and days, I won't be, unable to take a live session. Is, that recording, will be available,

588
01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:33.820
Monal Kumar: Yes.

589
01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:34.530
Siva Subramanian: Huh.

590
01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:51.300
Monal Kumar: The recording will always be available after the… see, we told that within 24 hours, we will process the recordings. That is our ATA, okay? You will see the recording after… and once the recording is uploaded, you can watch it, and yes, you can revise it again, so…

591
01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:52.959
Monal Kumar: You will be on track.

592
01:26:53.690 --> 01:27:00.539
Siva Subramanian: under, and, if I have a daughter, I can, contact us, so… Okay.

593
01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:18.519
Monal Kumar: So for us, for that, that is our communities there, right? You can… you can question, we will be there to answer, and again, as I'm… as Krishna mentioned, that it's not just for high and hello. We should not even do high and hello. We should ask serious questions there in the community, alright? So, please do that.

594
01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.469
Siva Subramanian: Alright, and also.

595
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:25.280
Monal Kumar: Wednesday, we have, in a different time, right? So you can also join the Wednesday classes.

596
01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:27.070
Monal Kumar: Huh. You get your party.

597
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:47.710
Siva Subramanian: Yeah, sure, model. And another question I have, as you said, there is a traditional method and a modern method, advanced method. If I… just now, we are starting from scratch for us. And, if I want to do a rest of the session, this course will be continuing to, that pathway, or else, yeah.

598
01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:58.110
Monal Kumar: It will always… this course will always… will always run on the traditional path, alright? Because the traditional path is where you make your base, alright? Base, understand everything.

599
01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:17.870
Monal Kumar: And if you want to jump from the base, but want to… is interested in building things, then you can jump to the modern way. Modern way is more focused on building things, solving things. Traditional way is more about, there is a difference between a researcher and an engineer, right? So traditional way makes you, between researcher and engineer.

600
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:21.990
Monal Kumar: And the modern way makes you kind of an engineer.

601
01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.120
Monal Kumar: All right.

602
01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:29.609
Siva Subramanian: Yes, whether we need to pay, the price, or else, if any discount will be available.

603
01:28:29.650 --> 01:28:37.410
Monal Kumar: For which one? For any query on those things, you can contact our team, alright? And they will be able to help you.

604
01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:39.719
Monal Kumar: I think Krisha already mentioned the…

605
01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:42.829
Monal Kumar: Number of the support team, right?

606
01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:43.810
Siva Subramanian: Okay.

607
01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:50.269
Monal Kumar: counseling team. So, you can check our counseling team, and they will be able to help you in any query on,

608
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:54.349
Monal Kumar: On these courses and prices of it. Alright?

609
01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.129
Siva Subramanian: Yeah, bye.

610
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:57.590
Monal Kumar: We'll be able to guide. Yes, yes, sure, she will.

611
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:01.380
Monal Kumar: Alright.

612
01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:05.570
Monal Kumar: So… On this album?

613
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:08.199
Monal Kumar: Sorry if I'm not pronouncing your name correctly.

614
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:15.569
Monal Kumar: Hello? Yes, you can… you're un… you are already unmuted.

615
01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:20.510
Monal Kumar: Guys, class recorded will be available to everyone.

616
01:29:21.330 --> 01:29:26.180
Monal Kumar: Can you hear me now? Yes, yes, I can hear you. Yeah, hi. Hi, Mona. Hello.

617
01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:33.780
Pandiselvam: Yeah, thank you, thanks for the session, and yeah, I… before, I have so many questions, so I got clarified from most of them.

618
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:44.260
Pandiselvam: The one final question is, yeah, I am currently working for a manual testing, so even dot pointer level, I don't have idea about the coding knowledge.

619
01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:57.050
Pandiselvam: So, before I was reaching out to the counseling team, before I was joining the session, they completely telling me that there is no prerequest, so everything will be covered in the session. Yeah, to understand, definitely I'm eager to waiting to learn this from you people.

620
01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:11.629
Pandiselvam: And one more thing is, okay, if I am learning today, okay, and you are giving some assignment, so I have done my part, how you can evaluate, and how you can guide me, and what is the output, and .

621
01:30:11.630 --> 01:30:24.709
Monal Kumar: I will tell you. See, now that we have LLMs also, right, I will tell you, I will give everyone a prompt, alright, when the time comes, and evaluation will happen automatically, okay? So don't worry about that.

622
01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:30.749
Monal Kumar: Now you have a lot of mentors in your hand. Everyone has a lot of mentors in their hand, called as LLMs, right?

623
01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.600
Monal Kumar: And, yep.

624
01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:44.100
Monal Kumar: So, don't worry, we will find a better way, but for sure, no one will be left out, everyone will be able to learn, and also understand from their mistakes also, so don't worry, okay?

625
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:48.259
Pandiselvam: Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, this is the question here. Thanks for answering.

626
01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.610
Monal Kumar: Yes, sure.

627
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:50.569
Pandiselvam: Have a good day.

628
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:51.830
Monal Kumar: Yes, you too have a good day.

629
01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:55.010
Monal Kumar: Okay, she is,

630
01:30:55.890 --> 01:31:02.870
Monal Kumar: How to access class recording, please clarify. All right, Sri, Krisha already showed you, but I will also

631
01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:23.110
Monal Kumar: revise it again. See everyone, anyone who has doubt on class recording, guys, this is your course section, this is what everyone will be able to see, but not all of that, but you will be able to see your courses. You can see, this is 2.2 Ultimate Data Science, this is your course. What you will do, you will…

632
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:36.650
Monal Kumar: go to this course, and this is your dashboard, alright? This is your dashboard. Today, we don't have any recordings available because this is the first session, but once that is done, you will see recorded sessions here.

633
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:45.770
Monal Kumar: Alright? Everyone will be able to see a new section here where all the recorded, all the live lectures that are recorded will be present here.

634
01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.620
Monal Kumar: Alright, everyone clear?

635
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:55.230
Monal Kumar: Guys, I will share my LinkedIn profile, don't worry. Okay, so this answers Sri's question.

636
01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.739
Monal Kumar: Okay, next we have Ujwal. Ujwal, you are next.

637
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:13.999
Monal Kumar: Guys, you always get notes, PDF, whatever we are writing, whatever we are writing code or writing things in the notepad, you will get PDF of those as a resource. Don't worry, we'll tell you as well.

638
01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:23.519
Krish Naik: I'm gonna tell you one more point about knowledge sharing, you know? Posting in the LinkedIn, how to… Yes, yes. Probably take a couple of minutes session on that.

639
01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:30.009
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure. All right, okay, before, Uchwell, just, I want to pause you for a minute, and then…

640
01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:30.530
Ujjwal: Okay.

641
01:32:30.710 --> 01:32:33.310
Monal Kumar: tell you one very important thing to everyone. Guys.

642
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:43.069
Monal Kumar: We live in social media era, okay? Everything HRC managers see, whatever they are able to see, they will interact with that.

643
01:32:43.170 --> 01:32:59.899
Monal Kumar: And if you're someone who is… there are a lot of people who are introverts. Even I was introvert before, and… but if you're not interacting with the social media, social media cannot interact with you. And who are social media? Who is social media? Other people around us, right? Other people around us.

644
01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:08.980
Monal Kumar: If you don't interact, trust me, I got my first freelancing gig, freelancing job, from social media, from LinkedIn.

645
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:18.829
Monal Kumar: So, if you want, if you want all of these opportunities, if you want other people to see you, that Krishna is mentioning, that we should share knowledge.

646
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:41.639
Monal Kumar: Alright? You should tell us that, okay, this is what I was able to learn from this class, this is what I'm going to post. But post in such a manner that other people want to read. I will also tell you how to post and how to create good posts. It only takes 3-4 minutes in the class, but I will only do it for one time, alright? Everyone should know how to do all of that. But if you don't share your learning, other people will never know that you are in the learning phase. What happens if someone wants an intern?

647
01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:55.320
Monal Kumar: They will only see people if I go to the LinkedIn and search for machine learning. I will also see posts for people who has tagged machine learning, who has learned from these places, who is writing machine learning, yes? Guys, agree or not? Write in the chat.

648
01:33:55.860 --> 01:34:09.919
Monal Kumar: If I want to get a PDF, just like a Google search, right? If I want to search something, those people, those links should come up, and if you're not coming up on those links, on those searches, it means you are already losing the opportunity.

649
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:28.499
Monal Kumar: So, this is pretty serious. I also tell this… I also told this in the previous batch, and people are doing it, people are interacting, and they get really, really good results. People interact, they get to know a lot of managers, their managers are interacting, other people are interacting. So, if you want opportunities, if you…

650
01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:31.990
Monal Kumar: It's not like, once the course is completed, then I will start posting. No.

651
01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:38.719
Monal Kumar: That is not how things work. People are not waiting for you. You are waiting for opportunities, and that's what you should do.

652
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:53.770
Monal Kumar: So everyone, will… will tell you what exactly how you should prepare things, how you should post things, but be, ready to post things, be ready to not be an introvert, at least on the social media. Is everyone clear?

653
01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.440
Monal Kumar: Is everyone clear?

654
01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:04.419
Monal Kumar: Alright? Yes. So, this is what everyone should be doing. I will tell you from the next one.

655
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.140
Monal Kumar: All right.

656
01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:18.919
Krish Naik: And please do make sure to tag us, so that we reshare the post. We try to bring more of your posts towards the audience, right? Who will be our common followers or connections. Okay?

657
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:28.320
Monal Kumar: Yes, because guys, if you don't tag us, if you're not able to see, people, someone who has a lot of, followers, a lot of people.

658
01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:47.589
Monal Kumar: If they comment or interact with your post, other people will also be able to see your post. So, we don't want other people to not see your post. We want other people to see it. So, whenever someone tags me, Krishna, or any mentors in the Christian Academy, we interact with that post, and you guys will be able to see that. Other people will also be able to see your most. You will have more impressions.

659
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:48.430
Monal Kumar: Alright?

660
01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.299
Monal Kumar: So guys, induction class will also be uploaded, alright?

661
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.690
Monal Kumar: Okay, next one.

662
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:59.649
Monal Kumar: Sudhir. Okay, sorry, Ojwal. Ojwal, you are the first one. Yes.

663
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:01.350
Ujjwal: Hi, Monal. Hi, Kish.

664
01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:09.630
Ujjwal: Mona just wanted to understand, like, how much of a mathematics concept is involved here, and which are the topics we should brush up in them for the maths?

665
01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:13.109
Monal Kumar: Basic mathematics, yes. First, complete your course,

666
01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:16.520
Ujjwal: And is MCPs also getting covered in this course?

667
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:22.880
Monal Kumar: Okay, Uchwell, have you checked the syllabus?

668
01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.550
Monal Kumar: Yes.

669
01:36:26.650 --> 01:36:36.460
Monal Kumar: So, in the syllabus, we are also completing MCP. I was just checking that, because we do have a lot of parallel classes. MCP is going to cover, that is the second question. First is.

670
01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:52.350
Monal Kumar: Mathematics, you should know… the basic mathematics, at least you should know what is… we are not focusing on trigonometry, but whoever completed trigonometry, there are basic mathematics classes like matrix multiplication. Don't worry, we will again teach what are the formulas we'll be using to do the multiplication, but for the familiarity.

671
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:56.859
Monal Kumar: If you have completed your 9th and 10th grade, then you… it will be more than enough.

672
01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:59.960
Monal Kumar: Okay, we will teach you from other, we will teach you further.

673
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:02.219
Monal Kumar: Is that clear, Virgil?

674
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:08.079
Ujjwal: Yeah, so, related to stats, like mean, median mode, all those things you will be covering, or we should be pretty.

675
01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.309
Monal Kumar: Everything. Everything.

676
01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:17.430
Monal Kumar: We will literally, for the initial 6 months, we will literally spoon-feed every piece of information.

677
01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:23.870
Monal Kumar: Then later, we want you to make a… become engineer, then the advanced part will come, alright?

678
01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.970
Monal Kumar: Thank you. This is for everyone. Yes, sure, RJ.

679
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:26.560
Ujjwal: Thank you.

680
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.130
Monal Kumar: Next, we have, Sudhir.

681
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:31.580
Monal Kumar: So then, you're.

682
01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.459
Sudheer Kumar: Hi, Manal, are you able to hear me?

683
01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.499
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, I can hear you.

684
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:42.560
Sudheer Kumar: Hi, Krisha. So, I have one question, actually. So, I am also an experienced person. So, currently, I'm working under VBA Project, Visual Basic Application.

685
01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:52.109
Sudheer Kumar: So, currently, whatever the product which I'm working, it is more than, I think, 4 to 6 months, then they will ramp up that project, so I need to jump into other projects.

686
01:37:52.240 --> 01:38:02.500
Sudheer Kumar: So, the meantime, whatever the course which I'm learning right now, right, so maybe 4-6 months, so will I be able to jump into that, data science journey after I…

687
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:04.920
Sudheer Kumar: months. Will I be able to try?

688
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:20.010
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, you will be able to try it. See, in the first initial six months, you will be able to understand machine learning and LP also, okay? And trust me that in any organization, there is around 50% to 60% scope for machine learning.

689
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:32.449
Monal Kumar: Right now, every project is Agentic EI rag. That is around 40-50%, but half of that is also machine learning, analysis, and all of those things that we will be learning in the first half of the course.

690
01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:39.090
Sudheer Kumar: Okay, because I am from the scratch of this Python and all those things, that's the reason I'm specifically asking this question.

691
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:54.320
Monal Kumar: Oh, no, don't worry, you will be able to jump. We are teaching in a way that you cover… that we will cover all the advanced part of it also, so in detail. So, maybe even the machine learning engineers will know less than you will be learning from here. So, that part we can guarantee.

692
01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.490
Sudheer Kumar: Okay, okay.

693
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:59.080
Monal Kumar: Yeah, okay. Thanks so much. Yes, you're welcome. Rohit?

694
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:03.640
Monal Kumar: Rohit, you're next.

695
01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.139
Monal Kumar: Alright, after Rohit, we have Sankal. Sankal?

696
01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:16.029
Rohit 9035527351: Sorry, can you hear me? Can you hear me now?

697
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:17.750
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, Rohit, I can hear you.

698
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:23.209
Rohit 9035527351: Yeah, so, sir, my… I have a buddy with basic, question, and

699
01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:29.600
Rohit 9035527351: Sir, what is the difference between this giant, like, agentic AI and gen… Jenny, I…

700
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:39.100
Rohit 9035527351: Okay. And I have no idea, and I'm very much new into this, so I'm looking forward, so… because I saw the other people are also asking the questions.

701
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.519
Rohit 9035527351: And, to be honest, I couldn't understand a bit what they were talking about.

702
01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.750
Monal Kumar: Okay, so see, first of all, this word even that you hear in these topics, generative.

703
01:39:48.870 --> 01:40:02.839
Monal Kumar: it holds a very deep meaning, it is not straightforward, okay? But if I talk about what, it is able to provide us, okay? So, if you talk with ChatGPT, have you ever used ChatGPT?

704
01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.550
Rohit 9035527351: Yes.

705
01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:11.140
Monal Kumar: what ChatGPT does, if you ask any query, what it does. What is the next thing you will say?

706
01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:12.929
Rohit 9035527351: I mean, like, it gives a…

707
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:18.710
Monal Kumar: provides you a response, right? And if you see that, word by word, it creates a response, right?

708
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:19.760
Rohit 9035527351: Yes.

709
01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:39.420
Monal Kumar: that what it's doing, it is generating, okay? So anything which your AI is creating, creating, generating, that is a part of generative AI, but in-depth part we will provide you later, because it is very technical. But if I talk about, in your day-to-day, if you see weather application, right?

710
01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:45.809
Monal Kumar: In a weather application, you will see tomorrow's forecasting, day after tomorrow forecasting, yes or no? 10 days forecasting. Yes?

711
01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:46.750
Rohit 9035527351: Yes.

712
01:40:46.750 --> 01:41:05.149
Monal Kumar: So, that, actually, we generate from machine learning, alright? Machine learning and all of those statistical-based methods, which we are going to learn. So, what we are doing, based on some historical data, based on some calculations, based on mathematics, we are forecasting what will happen in the next 10 days.

713
01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:11.580
Monal Kumar: And if I talk about the generative part, based on our query, AI is generating something that we want to see.

714
01:41:11.850 --> 01:41:26.760
Monal Kumar: Just like if I provide some video to the AI and ask that, in this picture, I want to dance like that picture. What AI is doing? AI is generating like that, right? So whenever AI is generating, just like a painter, just like humans think.

715
01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:32.629
Monal Kumar: That is a part of generative. When it uses mathematics and all of those things, that is a part of machine learning.

716
01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:37.719
Monal Kumar: Alright? So you will understand that more in later. But for now, everything will…

717
01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:41.920
Monal Kumar: Understand it like a vague topic, because it is very complex, alright?

718
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.920
Rohit 9035527351: No, no, no, actually, my question was, like, in terms of the example, like.

719
01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:53.110
Rohit 9035527351: Yeah. When the AI comes into the picture, when the agent API comes into the picture, that's it. I know that.

720
01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:53.650
Monal Kumar: Got it.

721
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:58.309
Monal Kumar: Maybe I will, I will, I will… we will learn into, like, our upcoming sessions.

722
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.829
Monal Kumar: But, was I able to clear your query, at least from the basic level? That's great.

723
01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.159
Rohit 9035527351: Thank you, thank you.

724
01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.140
Monal Kumar: Yes, you're right.

725
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:06.889
Monal Kumar: Then we have Sankarp.

726
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:13.120
Monal Kumar: And guys, when you are done, please unraise your hand. There is option to unraise your hand, alright? Yeah.

727
01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.030
sankalp: Hi, Emma are doing?

728
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:15.489
Monal Kumar: Yes, Sankar, your audiobook.

729
01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:19.200
sankalp: Hi, Chris, hi Mona, good morning, and thank you so much for the session.

730
01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:25.769
sankalp: I have few doubts, like, first of all, I have doubts, like, I have approximately 13 years of experience in QA automation.

731
01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:38.979
sankalp: So, I'm new to this, like, I have basic understanding of Python, but I'm new, you can say. So, it is possible for me that after having 13 years of experience in QA field, QA field, I can make transition maybe up to 1 year or 2 years.

732
01:42:39.330 --> 01:42:43.529
Monal Kumar: In my current company also, or maybe in outer, like, whenever I switch.

733
01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:47.340
sankalp: any job outside of it. So, it is possible, like, after…

734
01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:52.220
Monal Kumar: Are you a manager right now? No, no, I'm at lead position. Lead. You're at lead position, right?

735
01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:53.370
sankalp: Yes, yes.

736
01:42:53.370 --> 01:43:16.559
Monal Kumar: Yes, it is totally possible for you to switch, but for lead, you require a different skill set. You already have a skill set of leading people that you cannot learn from any course, that you only learn from experience, alright? But once you complete this course, and there are… I will tell you, there are different roadmaps also, that for a lead, for anyone to be a lead, they should know how to do a deployment, they should know the ends of

737
01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:31.919
Monal Kumar: After machine learning is done, what we should do? The scaling part and other things, that is what lead… that is what is expected from the lead. So that part you need to cover, and once you cover that, once you build things and scale, at least just in your project level.

738
01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:39.140
Monal Kumar: you will be able to tell your current company or other company that this is what I am doing, this is what I'm able to do. So it is totally doable.

739
01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:56.840
Monal Kumar: we will teach you the skills, we will teach you what to say in the interview, we will also tell you that… you can… whenever… once you have learned something, ask me in the LinkedIn that I want to… this is… I want to be this late, right? Then I will give you a project, if you complete it, then you will be,

740
01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.340
Monal Kumar: Ready for the next part of your life.

741
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.949
Monal Kumar: Being a lead in AI.

742
01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:01.880
sankalp: Right?

743
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:15.899
sankalp: Okay, a second thing, like, let's say, you mentioned, like, we will be following the traditional route, like, obviously from basic to advanced, like, ML, state ML, then deep learning, NLP, and then come to Gen AI and let Agent AI.

744
01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:16.460
Monal Kumar: Yes.

745
01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:34.009
sankalp: many people ask, like, the difference between Gen AI, Agent AI, and all. So, let's say after completing this course for one year, and now anyone, like, whosoever… nowadays, AI engineer, like, we used to listen or hear a lot of, like, AI engineer, AI engineer. So.

746
01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:41.090
Monal Kumar: as an AI engineer, like whosoever AI engineer, is able to do all this work, like, like, like, ML thing.

747
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.600
sankalp: MLT.

748
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.080
Monal Kumar: Have a great day.

749
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.069
sankalp: Okay. Everything. And Gen AI and Agentic AI is a part of this, like…

750
01:44:47.070 --> 01:45:04.549
Monal Kumar: Yes, it's a subpart of this course. You can… you can say that, okay? They are… machine learning stats is not directly taught in the generative AI, that is kind of a prerequisite of there. So, if you have that, it is good. Otherwise, they will teach you in a certain way that machine learning and stats will not come in the way of learning generative AI.

751
01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:15.029
sankalp: Okay, so after learning all these things in one year, if anyone wants to be specific to any particular field, so he or she can choose, like, maybe GenAI thing, or maybe Igent.

752
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:16.640
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

753
01:45:17.850 --> 01:45:21.530
sankalp: Okay. Yes. But as your experience, opinion, we should…

754
01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:25.040
sankalp: be open to this along, broad field, you can say, AIT.

755
01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.710
Monal Kumar: The way things are going, now everyone should be open to everything.

756
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:37.129
Monal Kumar: Okay? Okay. And if you can do everything, it means you can, retain your position.

757
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:41.200
sankalp: Yes, because nowadays is that, market is very tough.

758
01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:44.470
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes. Okay, thank you. Done everything. Yes, sure.

759
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:45.290
sankalp: Thank you, Mundo.

760
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:46.600
Monal Kumar: Yes, sure, Sanko.

761
01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:53.480
Monal Kumar: Alright, guys, Rohit and Sankarp, yes. Rohit, I'm raising your hand, and… Sai, you're next.

762
01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:58.580
Monal Kumar: Sign?

763
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:05.689
Monal Kumar: Am I audible? Am I audible? Yes, sir, you are audible. You're audible.

764
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:22.939
Sai: Thank you, thank you, Monol. Thank you, Kresh, for the… for this wonderful session, first of all. I'm asking very… rather, instead of questions as a request, I've had a chat with your… I think when I've gotten to this, Ishan is one of your executives, has got in touch with me, and specifically mentioned my requirement.

765
01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:38.809
Sai: I'm not sure whether you heard of that requirement. I'm having more than 15 years of experience in IT. I've been working in .NET, C, C++, and the last 6-7 years working as a scientist. Most importantly, the platform which you are, President would have demonstrated, no?

766
01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:49.800
Sai: Even the mobile application and the Krishna Academis platform. I'm not sure whether you heard this term. It is presently not digitally accessible. I mean, I'm not… are you aware about this term called digital accessibility?

767
01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:52.669
Sai: Have you… Krisha, you have…

768
01:46:52.670 --> 01:46:54.510
Monal Kumar: You're talking about accessibility functions?

769
01:46:54.510 --> 01:47:00.700
Sai: Yes. Accessibility, yeah. So, I'm a person with vision impairment model, just for your kind of information.

770
01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:02.470
Krish Naik: Screen reading software, Scrish.

771
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:10.609
Sai: So I've specifically requested this. I do agree that one-to-one is not possible, I completely respect that. But at least whenever you're taking the classes,

772
01:47:10.610 --> 01:47:11.130
Monal Kumar: Mmm.

773
01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:18.620
Sai: a small hint from your side that I'm writing a code inside this window, because I may not be able to follow your screen, because it is not possible for me, one, number one.

774
01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:41.200
Sai: And I'm not expecting, I do agree that you have got the burden of a lot of students, so I'm not expecting you to teach me one-on-one. I completely understand and respect that, but at least few hints from your side, you're doing this in your vendor, that's one request. That's one request. Another request, Kesh, presently, unfortunately, the platform which you've just demonstrated is not completely accessible. It has got a lot of accessibility violations.

775
01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.100
Sai: If your team needs any support, I'd be happy to help it.

776
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:49.019
Sai: Right from sharing resources, how to make it accessible, but it is not visibly accessible, unfortunately.

777
01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.519
Krish Naik: You're saying from the main site, right?

778
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:59.999
Sai: Yeah, the learning LMS, and even the mobile application, because I've been using mobile applications since morning, and then even…

779
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.180
Krish Naik: See, the thing is that this LMS, no, it's a third-party vendor LMS.

780
01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:23.399
Sai: I understand that. I saw the vendor name and everything. At least if you can just share this request with them, because sometimes what happens, they have to enable a few accessibility options. Accessibility is right from the design, but because a lot of buttons are unlabeled, a lot of controls are unlabeled, they're not keyboard operable, a lot of things which I'm facing, I do agree that it is not possible within one day or two days.

781
01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:28.530
Sai: But at least a request, if you can pass it on to them, that would be better, Chris. That's the first request on that. Okay?

782
01:48:28.530 --> 01:48:36.140
Krish Naik: See, I will, I will definitely share them this, issue, like, for, visually accessible, like.

783
01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:47.150
Sai: But only ask them to make it accessible for screen reader users, and if they need any specific requests and input from my side, let me know, because my research is in this area only. I've been working in this region.

784
01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:54.290
Krish Naik: Okay, can you do one thing? Can you just put me a small paragraph and write in the chat, so that I can copy this same thing and send to them, okay?

785
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:57.599
Sai: I will, I will, I will. You want me to do that on a community, or this here?

786
01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.349
Krish Naik: Yeah, here, your chat, Zoom chat. You just pinged me.

787
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:02.800
Sai: Because I'm actually accessing Zoom through phone.

788
01:49:03.190 --> 01:49:09.099
Sai: I'll have to… yes, yeah, because type in something. It takes some time for me, so if you want, I can share it.

789
01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:14.010
Krish Naik: Or you can drop this message to, yeah, I will, I will drop my email address, it's…

790
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:19.470
Sai: Yeah, that would've been… Sai, yes, my full name is Saeed Archen Bharat, I'm based out of Mumbai.

791
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:20.130
Krish Naik: Hmm.

792
01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:32.250
Sai: I know this is first time must be happening that your student is requesting this, I completely understand that. But yeah, I'd be happy, to be part of these sessions, and then would like to learn, of course.

793
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:33.350
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, sure.

794
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.740
Krish Naik: Excellent.

795
01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.829
Sai: Thank you, thank you so much.

796
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:36.509
Krish Naik: I'll send you my email ID, Sy.

797
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:43.250
Sai: Yes, I got it, I've received it, I've received it, I can hear it. Yes, perfect, perfect. I'll share my details. Thank you, Mona, thank you guys once again.

798
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:43.680
Monal Kumar: Thank you so much time.

799
01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:44.960
Sai: Thanks.

800
01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:49.539
Monal Kumar: Alright, now we have Prashant. Prashant, you're next.

801
01:49:52.840 --> 01:50:01.900
Krish Naik: Guys, don't forget to download the mobile app, so that you can also see the videos from the app itself. I've shared both the link for, Android and iOS. Thank you.

802
01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:10.850
Monal Kumar: Alright, so Prashant and, Candlesticks, that is a funny name. So, whoever is available.

803
01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:13.489
KandleSticks: Sorry, I had the wrong login.

804
01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.429
Monal Kumar: Alright, totally fine, yes.

805
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:30.899
KandleSticks: you know, more of an opinion or an advice, you know, I come with over two decades of leadership experience, and, you know, I've been out of coding and, you know, programming as such. But looking, you know, from technology into an AI domain.

806
01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:37.629
KandleSticks: Can you share your thoughts on how much of a help can this course bring in?

807
01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:41.929
KandleSticks: to my career shift, and what should I be focusing on? So it's more of…

808
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:42.550
Krish Naik: Totalized.

809
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:43.239
KandleSticks: I'm looking at.

810
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:48.969
Krish Naik: I would suggest to you, like, you should have not joined this, unless or until you want to make a fundamental strong.

811
01:50:49.130 --> 01:51:04.629
Krish Naik: You know, for you, the best batch would be generative AI and agentic AI, the modern route that we are falling, right? So that you get an idea of how to build an application, because since you're having 20-plus years of experience, you're mostly looking into the architectural level.

812
01:51:04.670 --> 01:51:10.809
Krish Naik: You know, where you understand about frameworks, where you understand about LLM Ops concepts, where you understand about the architecture part.

813
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:23.789
Krish Naik: So, that is what I would actually… had suggested you, instead you joining this, because I know you're not going to do the coding from scratch, and it will be of no use if you have 20 plus years of experience.

814
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.440
Krish Naik: Does that make sense?

815
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:33.940
KandleSticks: I mean, I am interested in learning the basics, because then, you know, it kind of sets the stage and, you know, makes my fundamental strong.

816
01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:35.880
KandleSticks: So…

817
01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:42.879
Krish Naik: No, no, I'm not saying in that way, sir. I'm saying in this way, like, you don't have to do the coding from scratch. In your case.

818
01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:44.089
KandleSticks: Got it, got it.

819
01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:59.889
Krish Naik: already so much experience. That is what I'm saying. Understanding, learning from fundamentals is always fine, okay? At any point of time, if you have sufficient amount of time. Okay? But I was thinking, like, how you can put your experience directly right now into the industries.

820
01:52:00.650 --> 01:52:05.449
KandleSticks: Got it. So, can I reach out to your teams to change, make changes? Okay.

821
01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:18.609
Krish Naik: Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely. And next month also, sir, we are coming up with one modern route batch, that is Generative AI, GenTech AI. You can join that batch. If you want my team, they'll move you to that particular batch once it is announced.

822
01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:21.959
KandleSticks: But if I have time, would you recommend I do both? So, on one.

823
01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.300
Krish Naik: Yeah, yeah. So, one route…

824
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.640
KandleSticks: So, strategically.

825
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:31.959
Krish Naik: So, one route I would definitely want to show it to you. So, just give me a second, okay?

826
01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:39.170
Krish Naik: So there are 3 routes which I have actually shared, and with respect to that, we are going to work with this. Do you see this? Advanced route?

827
01:52:40.210 --> 01:52:41.529
Krish Naik: All three parallel.

828
01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:54.040
Krish Naik: So, all three parallel basically means, you're also making your DS fundamentals strong, you are also working on Gen AI, mastering Gen AI, gentic AI, so that is the advanced route.

829
01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:56.830
KandleSticks: And is that a faster track, or…

830
01:52:57.050 --> 01:53:07.209
Krish Naik: Yeah, it is a faster track, because what I will do is that, in the upcoming classes, I'll give my Udemy courses of data science recordings, which will be for lifetime, which you can learn parallelly.

831
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:13.819
Krish Naik: If you're to increase the speed, and from the next month, whichever generative AI batch is getting launched, you can follow that track only.

832
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:16.919
KandleSticks: Thank you, thank you, Krish. Appreciate it.

833
01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:18.650
Krish Naik: Thank you.

834
01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:27.830
Monal Kumar: Alright, and then… we have… vinegar?

835
01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:35.080
Monal Kumar: Okay, you're next, and we have… Hello? Yes.

836
01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:35.830
KanikaG: Audible?

837
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:37.030
Monal Kumar: Yes, you're audible.

838
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:51.769
KanikaG: Yeah, actually, I wanted to, clarify regarding my working experience. I'm coming from a telecom background. I'm, currently I'm having 7 plus years of experience, and I'm… I was working as a senior software engineer.

839
01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.410
KanikaG: And, currently I'm not working.

840
01:53:54.410 --> 01:54:11.959
KanikaG: So, actually, I want to transition from non-tech to the tech background, and to be honest, I'm also parallelly currently learning the web development as well. So, I'm about to complete my front-end part about the JavaScript, so I was a bit concerned regarding, can both these things can be aligned?

841
01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:13.989
Monal Kumar: I will… I will tell you. Yes.

842
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.600
KanikaG: Yeah.

843
01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:30.239
Monal Kumar: So, currently, I think what you should do is, you should do a little bit of planning in terms of… because, as you said, telecom… telecom directly does not convert to web development. Web development is something that you build based on any requirement. It is totally based on requirement.

844
01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:47.239
Monal Kumar: For telecom, we don't exactly have a similar one-to-one mapping of web development, alright? For telecom, what you can do in telecom, we have different certifications, and in telecom, telecom directly converts to generative AI, agentic AI, as well as machine learning.

845
01:54:47.300 --> 01:55:09.729
Monal Kumar: Alright? So, there are domains. If you… I will tell you, if you have data, you can ping me on the LinkedIn, and in future, once you learn machine learning path, you can tell me that you want to build something like this, and I will help you, give you direction, so that you can proceed there. But web development is something that is good to have a skill for Agent care machine learning engineer, so that you can integrate, you can talk to, different teams.

846
01:55:09.730 --> 01:55:13.180
Monal Kumar: for the development part of it, but I would suggest to not

847
01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:17.070
Monal Kumar: Go deep dive into the web development part, because

848
01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:24.299
Monal Kumar: In a telecom, you have to convert your experience, right? And the best way to get into AI is via AI, not with development, web development.

849
01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:35.620
KanikaG: Actually, in my telecom domain, I was working in the configuration part, basically, so I'm now transitioning to the web, I mean, this coding only.

850
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:38.120
KanikaG: Yeah, I'm leaving the telecom domain now.

851
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:42.179
Monal Kumar: Alright, so where are you heading now? Which domain, exactly?

852
01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:47.099
KanikaG: I'm actually not working currently.

853
01:55:47.100 --> 01:56:03.270
Monal Kumar: It's totally fine, it's totally fine. You will understand it soon, because right now it is the initial phase of that, but don't worry, we are still here, alright? You will be joining the classes, and once you have more clarity, as I mentioned, go to Machine Learning. You're already learning machine learning, AI, and RAG in this course, right?

854
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:10.730
Monal Kumar: So you're already in the correct path. So once you know more about it, where you are and where you want to head, it will help you there. What is your next step?

855
01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:18.490
KanikaG: Yeah, I want to dedicate my next one year in this machine learning path only, so that's where I would be needing the help.

856
01:56:18.490 --> 01:56:21.559
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure. That's great, Kanika. We are here, alright?

857
01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.380
KanikaG: Yeah, thank you.

858
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:23.659
Monal Kumar: Yeah, yeah, you're welcome.

859
01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.189
Monal Kumar: Then, we have… Rahul Ahmed, and, yes.

860
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:32.500
Shahul Hameed: Hi, Monu, can you hear me?

861
01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:33.749
Monal Kumar: Yes, I can hear the show.

862
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:49.899
Shahul Hameed: So, Manil, I went through the syllabus, okay? So, after covering statistics and everything, I was just curious that, because what I understand is many people tell that you should know about calculus and linear algebra. Is that really required, or, like, how is it?

863
01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:59.829
Monal Kumar: Okay, when I will be teaching that, I will tell you that you… if you're… if you don't really understand mathematics, the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th standard mathematics.

864
01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:08.449
Monal Kumar: That is an optional part. You can understand from the overview how the flow works like. I will tell you, I will teach you that how to read and interpret those flows.

865
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:21.730
Monal Kumar: And inside these flows, there comes the mathematics. If mathematics part, you're not able to understand it clearly, in interviews, no one is going to say, derive this, integrate this. They will tell you what is the flow of it. If you understand the flow from a very high level, it is also totally fine.

866
01:57:21.730 --> 01:57:22.190
Shahul Hameed: Yeah.

867
01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:30.769
Monal Kumar: You're not going to be a researcher and build new things, right? You're just going to utilize and become the applied HNTKI, applied generative AI engineer, and that's what you will be.

868
01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.219
Shahul Hameed: One last question.

869
01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.159
Monal Kumar: Yes, sure, sure, yes.

870
01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:47.410
Shahul Hameed: Yeah, so thanks for that. So, I mean, since you're in this domain, you know there's a lot of changes always happening every month and every week. So I was also, you know, because it all started with this… what is that paper called?

871
01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:55.269
Shahul Hameed: what attention is all you need, and then the chat GPT, boom, big end, and everything. Are you going to teach us how to understand or interpret this research paper.

872
01:57:55.270 --> 01:58:15.230
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes. See, when we go to the deep learning part of it, we will start reading more about the research paper and how to interpret those. And this is for everyone, guys. Chrysler has been advancing from 2012 and 14, I think. Yes, sir? When you started learning this data science.

873
01:58:15.230 --> 01:58:30.759
Monal Kumar: So, guys, this learning will never stop. We always have to learn, Chris, there is already learning, creating new things, building new things, and that's what we all are doing. So, don't be scared of that. Once you have the clear base, the only thing that is… what is a new skill?

874
01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:47.760
Monal Kumar: I will invest some months on it, some weeks on it, and then you will be able to acquire that skill. But if the fundamental is not clear, then it will again be, like, where am I? Where is the head and tail of that particular skill? So, that issue… so if you don't want to face that issue.

875
01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:50.849
Monal Kumar: Stay in this particular path, and you'll be fine.

876
01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:52.539
Shahul Hameed: Thank you, Monu. Thanks.

877
01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:54.069
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, Sean, yes.

878
01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:58.640
Monal Kumar: Alright, and then, Satya, you're next.

879
01:58:59.790 --> 01:59:01.160
Monal Kumar: Satya and Danajay?

880
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:02.400
Monal Kumar: Satya first.

881
01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:04.619
Satya Panuganti: Hey, hi, Monal, and hi.

882
01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:05.460
Monal Kumar: Thanks, Sofia.

883
01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:16.860
Satya Panuganti: So, I'll give my background first, so that then I can kind of give you my questions. I am basically around, like, 15 plus years of experience, and I started… I hope I'm audible clearly, right?

884
01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:18.189
Monal Kumar: Yes, you're good, you're all good.

885
01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:22.830
Satya Panuganti: Yes, so I started my journey as a Linux engineer, then from Linux to cloud, and then.

886
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:23.310
Monal Kumar: Yes.

887
01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:36.340
Satya Panuganti: DevOps, and now I'm DevOps with multi-cloud. I'm working as an architect. And my recent project I've delivered is, you know, I have actually migrated one of the AI applications from AWS to Azure. So…

888
01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:47.009
Satya Panuganti: So, I have that kind of knowledge, and I'm, looking for getting this AIML stuff. So, my question is basically, like, do I kind of…

889
01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:52.829
Satya Panuganti: you know, include or incalculate the MLOps or AIP stuff.

890
01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:58.659
Satya Panuganti: or should I kind of go to the data science or AML area? What do you.

891
01:59:58.660 --> 01:59:59.430
Monal Kumar: What's your one?

892
01:59:59.430 --> 02:00:02.120
Satya Panuganti: Yes, yes. You and Krish can answer both.

893
02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:19.969
Monal Kumar: DevOps is nothing but machine learning operations, plus the DevOps part of it. You already are clear in the DevOps part of it, right? Right. Once you understand machine learning, there will be few steps included in the DevOps, which you already know, the DevOps part of it, right? So, as your senior, you already know how to engineer things, right?

894
02:00:19.970 --> 02:00:31.209
Monal Kumar: And once you understand machine learning, what are the artifacts of it, it is just like creating a flow of it in a manner where you can, maintain the CI-CD part of it, right? Integration and development part.

895
02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:31.870
Satya Panuganti: Right.

896
02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:51.769
Monal Kumar: But in terms of machine learning, so you will be able to do it. So I would suggest you not directly going to the MLOps, because you already know that. And, stay in this path, you will understand that once machine learning is done, how I should productionize this. If you're able to do it, then you're already in the MLOps part. That's all. Machine learning in DevOps is MLOps.

897
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:52.770
Monal Kumar: Got it.

898
02:00:52.770 --> 02:01:01.240
Satya Panuganti: Okay, okay. Yeah, another question is basically, like, regarding this, it's a course of 12 months, right?

899
02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:05.409
Satya Panuganti: After 12 months, like, how about the access to the recordings and all that?

900
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:11.430
Monal Kumar: Yes, you will get access. As Krishna mentioned, you have 1,000 days of access, alright?

901
02:01:11.570 --> 02:01:12.280
Satya Panuganti: to…

902
02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.560
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

903
02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:14.259
Satya Panuganti: Rose to look at.

904
02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:16.779
Monal Kumar: So, yeah, you will have access to this course.

905
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:21.339
Satya Panuganti: Okay, and my third question is, like, I know the basics of Python and all that stuff.

906
02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:33.710
Satya Panuganti: Okay, so, where previously I have some kind of requirements where, I mean, some… from companies, like, from Switzerland, they have… I have interviewed for…

907
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:48.300
Satya Panuganti: they are using our programming language in their, statistics and analysis at the share market and all. So, so what's the basic, the idea is, like, Python versus R.

908
02:01:48.340 --> 02:02:00.700
Monal Kumar: Okay. The R is mostly, again, used by a team who does analytics and statistics, alright? This is where they're using R. In R, we also have R, so I need to create dashboards, right?

909
02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:23.759
Monal Kumar: But that is a very, small requirement. If you see on LinkedIn, if you see 200… I will not even say 100, if you see 200, 300 jobs, one of them will mention that R is optional, or one of them will ask that, yes, we require R as the mandatory skill. But other than that, everything is Python, SQL, PySpark, and other things, alright?

910
02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:32.600
Monal Kumar: So, if you, know that, I will not suggest you to target just the R companies. The skill which you don't know. You know a lot of skills, apply on that particular part.

911
02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:41.060
Satya Panuganti: Okay, the one last question is, like… Sure. So it's basically, like, I just forgot, like…

912
02:02:41.230 --> 02:02:41.960
Monal Kumar: That's recognize that.

913
02:02:42.110 --> 02:02:44.580
Satya Panuganti: What's stop it.

914
02:02:45.150 --> 02:02:49.140
Monal Kumar: You can again raise your hand, you can again let me know, alright?

915
02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:50.420
Monal Kumar: Is that fine?

916
02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:52.290
Satya Panuganti: I remember now?

917
02:02:52.290 --> 02:02:53.280
Monal Kumar: You can continue.

918
02:02:56.750 --> 02:03:20.479
Satya Panuganti: Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it. So, I actually… I actually do the trainings as well. I've also done, like, online, corporate, physical classes in institutes and everything I've done on both DevOps and cloud, okay? I'll tell you my query, why I'm telling this, because when I teach to the different domain people, when people are migrating to DevOps or cloud.

919
02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.519
Satya Panuganti: We'll ask all these questions what they're asking now.

920
02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:37.550
Satya Panuganti: Right, so I used to answer the similar questions. So, in my training, what I used to tell them is, like, you know, once you're done with the training, you'll get an experience level of 3 to 4 years. That's why, that's where I kind of target.

921
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:38.220
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

922
02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:39.620
Satya Panuganti: So, how about this?

923
02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:48.610
Satya Panuganti: course curriculum, and after this, like, how much I can gain, how I can match to a professional who is really working on AIRML stuff?

924
02:03:48.610 --> 02:04:01.240
Monal Kumar: I will tell you, the professional in AI right now is all over the place. There is no standard metric, okay? Companies are saying 5 to 7 for a senior role, and still they are hiring for 2 to 3 years experience, because

925
02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:16.100
Monal Kumar: It is not based on years of experience in this particular field. What happens if someone is working on genetic and bad to build a lot of amazing projects? Even the fresher now… fresher, not even fresher, even the people who are in college, not even completed their degree, they're able to build things, alright?

926
02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:30.660
Monal Kumar: So, it totally depends on… if the company requirement says plus 3 years, then obviously the fresher will not be able to apply, but the fresher ones join the startup, they will be able to complete their… transfer their knowledge to their years of experience directly.

927
02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:36.410
Monal Kumar: Right? So it totally depends on where we are applying what is the company requirements, but based on the knowledge.

928
02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:51.190
Satya Panuganti: No, the question is not about the how many years of experience. The question is, like, after the completion of this course, if I were to be able to answer on projects and all, so where my skill set will match to a real, working professional.

929
02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:56.970
Monal Kumar: You will be able to match to a working professional of 2 to 3 years of experience.

930
02:04:58.130 --> 02:04:58.630
Satya Panuganti: Okay.

931
02:04:58.890 --> 02:04:59.610
Satya Panuganti: Got it.

932
02:04:59.610 --> 02:05:02.969
Monal Kumar: Two to three years' experience relevant in AI Engineering.

933
02:05:03.170 --> 02:05:04.969
Satya Panuganti: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

934
02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:06.150
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

935
02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:11.430
Monal Kumar: Look, yeah, that's all I have. Yeah, sure, Satan. Let's great. Then we have the nunchay.

936
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:14.680
Dhananjay: Good morning, sir, am I audible?

937
02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.729
Monal Kumar: Yes, you're audible.

938
02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:18.329
Dhananjay: First of all, good morning.

939
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:37.099
Dhananjay: Sir, actually, I want to ask or highlight, some points, like, like, I'm a student, I'm a pre-family student in engineering CSE, and I guess measure of our community contains, like, experienced person in, industry, so I just wanted to highlight a point that,

940
02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:47.840
Dhananjay: a few better, teach us from scratch, like, even some of us, like, students don't know how to, like, post on GitHub. Like, I personally don't know how to…

941
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.419
Dhananjay: on GitHub and LinkedIn, so please, I would like, like, you will teach us…

942
02:05:53.420 --> 02:06:10.519
Monal Kumar: Sure. We will teach, we will teach, as I mentioned, right, even how to post on LinkedIn, what things you should need to mention. I will create some kind of a prompt or something, which we will help you guys to do that, and anything, as I mentioned, for the first 6 months, we are literally going to spoon-feed everyone, okay?

943
02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:15.300
Monal Kumar: So, you're going to… there is no prerequisite, there is no gaps in our knowledge.

944
02:06:15.710 --> 02:06:18.940
Monal Kumar: That is going to stop you from learning this course, alright?

945
02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:19.989
Dhananjay: So, thank you so much.

946
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:22.140
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, yes, no problem.

947
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:26.310
Monal Kumar: Alright, shiva? Supra Mannyam?

948
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:41.070
Siva Subramanian: Yes, Monaza. I am almost, in BPO, almost a level, yes, as a senior business process, not a team leader. And, I want to know, I've started doing as a…

949
02:06:41.110 --> 02:06:51.560
Siva Subramanian: data sciences courses, I don't, I thought to do, but, I don't know whether I can get that job, or I'll do freelances from this.

950
02:06:51.610 --> 02:06:56.429
Siva Subramanian: what I can apply and how I can get, output from it.

951
02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:57.370
Siva Subramanian: Oh, no.

952
02:06:57.370 --> 02:07:04.630
Monal Kumar: Shiva, once you learn something for the first initial six months. See, if it, have you,

953
02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:10.600
Monal Kumar: Did you want to any of those websites which provides freelancing gigs? Freelancing jobs?

954
02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:15.880
Monal Kumar: Have you enrolled in any one of them? Have you logged in or signed up to any of those?

955
02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.950
Monal Kumar: Freelancers places.

956
02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:22.959
Siva Subramanian: Yeah, work, I just enrolled it, I see lots of…

957
02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:29.299
Monal Kumar: tech in Upwork and everything, freelancing is mostly on the things that are latest in the market. They require help, quick help, right?

958
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:50.840
Monal Kumar: And the quick market is Generative AI, Agent TKI, machine learning and other things are mostly kind of a full-time, but still, they are a freelancing part of it. So if you want to go into the freelancing part of it, I will suggest you to, in parallel, work with Generative AI and Agent Kai. That will cover your ground on the freelancing part of it, okay? I will also help you how to do the freelancing others. We'll teach you in the course, okay?

959
02:07:51.210 --> 02:07:56.260
Monal Kumar: And, for… what was the other question? This is the freelancing part is done.

960
02:07:56.870 --> 02:08:00.759
Siva Subramanian: Yeah, another part is, I'm more than level years of experience.

961
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:07.850
Siva Subramanian: In a BPO part, I was starting this course as starting from scratch, whether I'm able to get a job.

962
02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:09.010
Siva Subramanian: That's a thing.

963
02:08:09.010 --> 02:08:09.440
Monal Kumar: We will pay.

964
02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:10.009
Siva Subramanian: Can you catch up.

965
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:20.900
Monal Kumar: You see, first thing for any senior is to convert their current experience to the AI part of it, okay? Once you understand anything, once you're… if you see some problem in your current job.

966
02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:33.679
Monal Kumar: I'm talking about problem statement, not a problem, but a problem statement in your current job. What you can do, you can create a minimal viable product, MVC, okay, MVP, and also create a POC of it. Then you can pitch those POCs to your team, because

967
02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:40.020
Monal Kumar: Managers and higher-ups only want that… how to convert clients into

968
02:08:40.170 --> 02:08:44.330
Monal Kumar: like, for better, transition, right? Clients will pay for.

969
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.910
Siva Subramanian: Okay.

970
02:08:44.910 --> 02:09:01.340
Monal Kumar: If you can create something for that, they will be able to convert else, convert that into some other company. So once you have that confidence that you can build something, then you will be able to switch it. So, I will help you build that confidence, but it is totally up to you what you want to build, how much you will practice on that.

971
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:04.129
Siva Subramanian: Yes, thank you, sir. Yeah.

972
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:05.180
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure.

973
02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:10.929
Monal Kumar: Yes, and next is Satya, did we already cover yours?

974
02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:14.080
Monal Kumar: Tanika?

975
02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:15.120
Monal Kumar: Kanika?

976
02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:33.259
KanikaG: Yeah, I have one more question, just… Yes, sure. Yeah, a small question. Since this is an induction session, and in the course section also, there is the Get Started section, and there are around 5 videos in it. So, before Wednesday, do we need to complete those videos?

977
02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:36.020
Monal Kumar: you don't need, that is for Fast Track. If you guys want to.

978
02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:40.970
KanikaG: Or, I mean, it will be teaching us from scratch or something.

979
02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:43.580
Monal Kumar: That will always teach you from scratch, okay?

980
02:09:43.590 --> 02:09:57.390
Monal Kumar: So, if you want to do Fast Track, you guys can check those 5 lectures, those are big lectures, but you can cover things one by one. And if you want to learn… because that's… that is a different syllabus as compared to this one, but that covers the major part of what we are going to learn.

981
02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:04.299
Monal Kumar: the major blocks of it. Here, we have major blocks, a lot of… many blocks, a lot of newer tools also that we'll be covering in the course, right?

982
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:07.690
Monal Kumar: That is different, this is different. For the faster, you can refer that.

983
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:08.740
Monal Kumar: Alright.

984
02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:12.050
Monal Kumar: Monica?

985
02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:15.449
Monal Kumar: Guys, am I audible?

986
02:10:17.630 --> 02:10:18.090
Krish Naik: Yes, ma'am.

987
02:10:18.090 --> 02:10:25.519
Monal Kumar: Okay, okay, sure. I think something is strong on the Khanika side. Okay, Satya, is your doubt already clear, Satya?

988
02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:27.520
Monal Kumar: Anuganti?

989
02:10:31.410 --> 02:10:34.360
Monal Kumar: Alright, next one is… Gomati?

990
02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.490
Monal Kumar: Bomati?

991
02:10:37.090 --> 02:10:38.610
Satya Panuganti: Hey, hi, Monand. Hello.

992
02:10:38.610 --> 02:10:39.030
Monal Kumar: Right.

993
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:40.919
Satya Panuganti: Sorry, Monal, you called me?

994
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.469
Monal Kumar: Satya, your doubt is already cleared, right?

995
02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:44.480
Satya Panuganti: Yaya.

996
02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:48.109
Monal Kumar: Okay, I'm moving, go ahead. Yes, sorry, Komathy, you can go next.

997
02:10:48.460 --> 02:11:04.300
Gomathi KARNAN: Yeah, first of all, I have been, I heard your meetings before, so it was very good. So, I have 3 questions, Monal. So, first question is, what are the different roles we can apply once we complete this course, or while doing this course?

998
02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:12.690
Monal Kumar: all roles. This course is designed so that you can apply to all the roles. I showed you, right, what… I showed you the screen, I think?

999
02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:26.019
Monal Kumar: Where I have all of these roles. At the start of this page, you will be able to see these roles. Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, deep learning engineer, AI Engineer, eject AI engineer.

1000
02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:27.749
Gomathi KARNAN: You can apply to all of these rules.

1001
02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:48.660
Gomathi KARNAN: Okay, so I have second question. How can we keep ourselves outstanding as, you know, industry standards keep updating, or, and the role also, role requirement also keep update, getting updated? So, how can we keep ourselves, outstanding every time it gets updated?

1002
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:51.149
Monal Kumar: See, once you ha- as I'm…

1003
02:11:58.740 --> 02:11:59.270
Krish Naik: There's no…

1004
02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:00.389
Monal Kumar: Is it good now?

1005
02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:01.790
Krish Naik: Yeah.

1006
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:03.430
Monal Kumar: Correct, alright, yeah, something happened.

1007
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:21.849
Monal Kumar: Okay, so, as I mentioned before, that once you have the base clear for any new skill, it is very easy to learn, alright? But to implement, you have to become a kind of… you have to have an engineer kind of a mindset, that I have to integrate this, this is a new tech skill, I have to… Okay, answer me.

1008
02:12:21.850 --> 02:12:28.580
Monal Kumar: If a new app comes in your Play Store or iOS store, do you feel…

1009
02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:31.750
Monal Kumar: that I'm not able to use this application.

1010
02:12:32.150 --> 02:12:33.060
Gomathi KARNAN: Nope.

1011
02:12:33.230 --> 02:12:52.390
Monal Kumar: No, but it does have some kind of a learning curve at the start, right? Where are different tabs of it, what I will be doing with these apps, it does have some kind of a learning. So, similarly, once you're an experienced professional, once you understand the base of it, it all feels like a new kind of application. Yes, it does have application, that app does something.

1012
02:12:52.390 --> 02:13:04.430
Monal Kumar: But it does have a base that, okay, this application does have setting. From the setting, I can do certain things. From the home, I will be able to see something, see all the things. From the payment, I will be able to see my payment and subscription. Yes.

1013
02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:16.389
Monal Kumar: All of them have some kind of a basic that, is also present in our technical part. If you learn Python, machine learning, and others, you will see that, with the help of these technologies, you will solve some X problem.

1014
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:24.719
Monal Kumar: With the help of databases, you will solve some Y problem. With the help of API, you solve some Z problem. So everything… technologies are based on problem.

1015
02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:33.880
Monal Kumar: and their solution. So once you know that, it is very easy to learn things. But yes, your base should be very clear. And that's what you're going to build here, Gomati.

1016
02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:38.160
Gomathi KARNAN: Thank you, Monand. And my third question is, so…

1017
02:13:38.160 --> 02:14:01.209
Gomathi KARNAN: as we'll be showcasing ourselves here by the end of this course, we may be, 2 plus years of experience person, as knowledge as them. So, here, since we are, some of them are already experienced and some might be fresher, so I'm an experienced person, so here I have to showcase myself as a fresher in this domain, or, I should show myself as 2 plus years of experience and try a job…

1018
02:14:01.210 --> 02:14:15.880
Monal Kumar: show yourself as a… because otherwise, how they are going to come… how you're going to compete with others? Because if you're competing with freshers, that is not really converting your experience, right? But, as I always mention, even HR knows that, that

1019
02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:21.340
Monal Kumar: Whatever you have learned from all of the 7 years experience, 10 years experience, 20 years experience.

1020
02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:30.279
Monal Kumar: That you cannot learn as a fresher. Yes, you do know how to manage things, you don't know how to talk to clients, you don't know how to communicate with teams and other things. Yes, Gumati?

1021
02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:34.059
Gomathi KARNAN: Yes, yes. That… do you think that Fresher has that skill?

1022
02:14:34.330 --> 02:14:35.799
Gomathi KARNAN: No, it comes with experience.

1023
02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:48.390
Monal Kumar: Yes, it comes with experience. So, you already have something. What you have to do is use those experience which you've learned in all of those years, and convert that with AI, ML, and all of those things. So, you are a professional… you are a professional then.

1024
02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:56.059
Monal Kumar: So, yes, you will be able to convert it. I will help you, how many years of experience, with the help of these projects, what you can do later.

1025
02:14:56.450 --> 02:14:57.160
Monal Kumar: Okay.

1026
02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:01.060
Gomathi KARNAN: Okay, so in such case, our salary and experience will also get compensated.

1027
02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:03.080
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1028
02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.149
Gomathi KARNAN: Okay, thank you so much, Mona, thanks.

1029
02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:06.560
Monal Kumar: Sure, Komati. Yes.

1030
02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.360
Gomathi KARNAN: Have a nice day.

1031
02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:08.550
Monal Kumar: Yes, I'm a nice dinner.

1032
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:11.310
Monal Kumar: And… Diane?

1033
02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:13.250
Monal Kumar: Dan?

1034
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:15.660
Jayanth Krishna: Hi, am I audible?

1035
02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:16.690
Monal Kumar: Yes, you're audit.

1036
02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:26.510
Jayanth Krishna: Yeah, first of all, a very big thank you for arranging this session, and yeah, I used a wrong login. Jayint is my son's name, and my name is Satish.

1037
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:29.799
Monal Kumar: Oh, and I taste a dish. Yeah, yeah. So.

1038
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:46.230
Jayanth Krishna: Also, I have a couple of questions. So, first thing is, let me tell my background. So, I come from a… I'm right now working in a MNC, a product development MNC, and right now I'm working as an architect, and I'm having about 20-plus years of experience.

1039
02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:57.009
Jayanth Krishna: Right, so my tech… my experience, or the ones which in our company are mostly in .NET, C Sharp, and Java.

1040
02:15:57.260 --> 02:16:08.290
Jayanth Krishna: Right, and and, like, the, the opportunities within the company and, for the AI and ML are there, but it is very limited.

1041
02:16:08.290 --> 02:16:18.460
Jayanth Krishna: And I'm not sure if I can get an opportunity there. So my question is, like, I mean, I'm very much eager to learn all these things, and

1042
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:33.199
Jayanth Krishna: and absorb all these things. Like, how do I approach, like, if I want to transition from my current position as a Java architect or something into a AI GenA architect or some other AI-related role?

1043
02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:48.179
Jayanth Krishna: So, how do I transition my things? And, with also with respect to the projects, right? Projects and the, like, architecture. So, how do I attack this when, let us say, if I, after this, I… I under… I understood or I learned.

1044
02:16:48.180 --> 02:17:00.610
Jayanth Krishna: And I want to explore more opportunities, right? So, or to approach other companies. So, how do I make myself ready with respect to projects and other things? Can you help me in that?

1045
02:17:00.610 --> 02:17:12.529
Monal Kumar: Sure, sure. All right, as an architect, I think from my point of view, whenever… from my experience working with architects, architects are not bound by even technologies or languages, right?

1046
02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:24.860
Monal Kumar: Some of the modules might be written in Go, some of the modules might have been written in Java, some of them might be written in C++. Architect job is never to see the language, architect job is to solve the problem. I think this is what you are being solving also.

1047
02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:25.700
Jayanth Krishna: Shoot, yes.

1048
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:37.430
Monal Kumar: Yes, so in terms of architect level, we should also think of an AI as a module in the whole picture, because AI is not a product by itself.

1049
02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:42.459
Monal Kumar: In terms of product, there are a lot of moving components that creates a product, yes?

1050
02:17:42.639 --> 02:17:43.159
Jayanth Krishna: Yep.

1051
02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:59.780
Monal Kumar: So AI will also be in that product, it can be in a product of Java ecosystem, but in that Java, Java will be calling via some API, which AI engineers will be handling it, and AI engineers will be creating that endpoints, which will be answering whatever the request is. It can be stats request.

1052
02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:12.529
Monal Kumar: It can be another metrics, it can be even NLP request, like a generative AI, or create an image, a video, anything, right? But the whole ecosystem that you have already covered, that is with Java and other things, that is, like, the 90% of the application.

1053
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:31.809
Monal Kumar: the 10% in terms of the whole product comes the AI part of it, because AI comes at the end of it, like a functionality that we are adding, a cool functionality, or some kind of a new ROI which we want to convert from the client. So, to convert your experience to an AI architect, all you do is understand this AI concept which we are doing.

1054
02:18:31.809 --> 02:18:47.480
Monal Kumar: But in terms of problem statement or product, how you're going to integrate it, what are the different components which you'll be requiring, maybe in terms of database schema, what you'll be requiring? Of course, being an architect, database schema, creating all of those things, API requests, concurrency, and other things comes also, right?

1055
02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:59.069
Monal Kumar: In AI, that will also come. Concurrency and other things part. So, once we solve some kind of a project, then what you will be doing, you will be converting those that, now this is a machine learning.

1056
02:18:59.070 --> 02:19:13.320
Monal Kumar: what I should do more to make the system scalable on the production level. And that will make you an AI architect, so it is not too much of work, but you do need to understand concurrency failure in terms of AI, which you already know in terms of other applications, Java.

1057
02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:14.160
Jayanth Krishna: Correct.

1058
02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:29.650
Monal Kumar: Right? So, it is not too much of work, but yes, you do need to understand high level that this is what it does, because architects don't deal with variables, I want to create variable 3 and other things, right? You deal with… yes. So, that's what you will be doing. It is not too different.

1059
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.899
Jayanth Krishna: Okay.

1060
02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:32.080
Monal Kumar: content, okay?

1061
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:33.479
Monal Kumar: generated very easily.

1062
02:19:33.649 --> 02:19:52.389
Jayanth Krishna: Yes. And also, I have one question. So, like, Krishna was mentioning about, another batch, another batch in the next month, which starts with the generative AI. Yes, yes, yes. So, like, what is the difference between these, these two batches? So, it is also a one-year course, or it is a…

1063
02:19:52.390 --> 02:20:06.869
Monal Kumar: No, no, no, it will not be a one-year course. It will pay five to six months of course. It is mostly focused on the specialization. Once we learn deep learning, deep learning has specializations, like computer vision, generative AI,

1064
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:21.740
Monal Kumar: NLP part of it, right? Those part, we will directly start from there. So this course, Machine Learning and LP, as Krishna mentioned, that that is the first half of this course. After that first half, we start with Generative AI and LP, and the specializations of those will come in that course, not here.

1065
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:29.439
Monal Kumar: So it is a little different from there. Not little, but too much of difference in terms of specialization. There, it will be more specialized, alright?

1066
02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:30.070
Jayanth Krishna: Okay.

1067
02:20:30.310 --> 02:20:30.950
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1068
02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:34.379
Monal Kumar: Yes, sure.

1069
02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:39.270
Monal Kumar: Alright, next we have, Lokesh. Lokesh, you're next.

1070
02:20:42.430 --> 02:20:53.640
Lokesh Aggarwal: Yeah, hi. So, again, my question is, since the course covers around 50, I mean, a number of topics, right? So, my question is, at the end of the course, how much

1071
02:20:53.800 --> 02:21:07.709
Lokesh Aggarwal: we as a student, I mean, would be able to learn those things, because, you know, generally what I have seen, you know, around… after completion of the course, we generally remember 40-50% of the course. So.

1072
02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:17.210
Lokesh Aggarwal: I mean, would that… we would be able to, I mean, translate those things that we have grasped into our, you know, actual roles, or not?

1073
02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:18.200
Monal Kumar: Yes, agreed.

1074
02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:27.779
Lokesh Aggarwal: very difficult, you know, to, I mean, to understand and learn and grasp X, I mean, A to Z, right?

1075
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:31.840
Monal Kumar: Okay, see, personally…

1076
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:40.420
Monal Kumar: Some topics, it might be harder for some people, and some… another X topic might be harder for some other group of people.

1077
02:21:40.460 --> 02:22:03.129
Monal Kumar: But it is totally fine if we don't understand something in this first initial phase of our learning. If someone is starting this data science from the very scales, they don't know anything about coding or data science or machine learning, right? They have not… they only have heard it. It is totally fine to skip something and not remember something, because once we go into the practice, you might work for… first 6 months, you might work for just machine learning.

1078
02:22:03.130 --> 02:22:08.639
Monal Kumar: So whatever we have evolved or learned from agility care journey will not come into practice. That is totally fine.

1079
02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:13.399
Monal Kumar: But, if you have an understanding just from the conceptual point of view that these are the things present.

1080
02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:23.120
Monal Kumar: Then, next time, for the next 6 months, if you're in your company, then a new project comes for AgentK and Genet API. What you will do? Are you in Ground Zero? Or do you know something?

1081
02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:29.249
Monal Kumar: You will know something, right? You will know something. You already have that base. So what you will do?

1082
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:43.030
Monal Kumar: From that base, you will start creating projects and then take experience from a generative AI part of it. So learning happens in different stages in your career also. It's not like once this course is completed, you will be able to remember everything. No, you will not be able to remember everything.

1083
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:52.430
Monal Kumar: So, it is totally fine, and you will not face any issue until unless you have the concepts clear, because in the job also, you will be able to rev… you will be revising a few concepts.

1084
02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:55.110
Monal Kumar: Don't be prepared for everything. It happens.

1085
02:22:55.110 --> 02:23:14.249
Lokesh Aggarwal: My second question is, like, right now I'm working as a cloud architect and having around 18 to 20 years of experience. So, after going through with this course, so on which role do you see, you know, we should, you know, start looking for? I mean, is it lead.

1086
02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:19.130
Lokesh Aggarwal: Paul… I mean, obviously not as an AI engineer, or…

1087
02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:27.190
Lokesh Aggarwal: I mean, since I'm already working as an architect, so I don't know whether we would be able to, you know, move into an… as an AI architect or not.

1088
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:39.840
Monal Kumar: things like lead, from the lead perspective in AI, in AI field, lead is someone who also knows ops, ops, okay? And you already know ops, the cloud part of it, the cloud integration and other things.

1089
02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:49.419
Monal Kumar: So, you can directly translate to ML Ops Engineer, GenAI Engineer. Gen AI Engineer, you will be learning the Gen AI components of it, but the ops part of it, you will be able to translate directly.

1090
02:23:50.170 --> 02:24:02.540
Monal Kumar: Alright? You… I'm not suggesting you to become some kind of ML engineer, but an engineer who know how to deploy things, and right now, industry requires a lot of these people, which you can directly translate to.

1091
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:06.630
Monal Kumar: MLOps engineer, LLM Ops, that part will be for you.

1092
02:24:06.820 --> 02:24:07.620
Monal Kumar: Okay.

1093
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:08.940
Lokesh Aggarwal: Okay, thank you.

1094
02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:10.140
Monal Kumar: Yeah, share location.

1095
02:24:10.450 --> 02:24:11.870
Monal Kumar: Vishal, you're next.

1096
02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:26.169
Vishal Singh: Hey, hi. Hello, Chris Lamar. So, okay, so I'll start with my introduction first. So, I'm working in an automotive industry with a traditional CE development and auto-source stack at the lower hardware level.

1097
02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:34.579
Vishal Singh: But there is a… I'm a software architect with 14 years of experience. By the time this course ends, I will be completing almost 15. But…

1098
02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:46.070
Vishal Singh: As we all know, there is a lot of advancements are going on into the automotive industry, like ADAS, the telematics, the software-defined vehicle. Where is the lot of use of the AI?

1099
02:24:46.530 --> 02:25:05.419
Vishal Singh: So, being in a technical field, I wanted to learn this technology to be up to the mark, where the current trends are going in the automotive. So, I have some questions. Yeah, automotive, yes. So, it's not the complete data science which I did, or I'm doing, but I have to now, because going forward, the trend is like that.

1100
02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:20.390
Vishal Singh: So, I have some questions here. In the projects, whatever we will be executing during the course of this time, will it be any domain-specific projects also? Like, something in the ADAS, we have this computer vision mostly used… Oh, see.

1101
02:25:20.390 --> 02:25:30.660
Monal Kumar: ADAS is a domain in the real world, okay? So, ADAS is something that you require hardware, and ADAS is not a part of traditional computer vision, it is a part of 3D computer vision.

1102
02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:32.870
Monal Kumar: Okay, so those…

1103
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:46.149
Vishal Singh: It's okay, ADAS is one part, so there are the many things, like protective maintenance, the diagnostics, the fleet management into the telematics industry is being used also, like, Ola and Uber are also using this part.

1104
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:55.839
Vishal Singh: So, like, okay, any things which is, like, the domain-specific projects, or any live working support on ongoing industry projects we can expect, or something like that?

1105
02:25:56.490 --> 02:26:07.349
Monal Kumar: say, live working support on the project that is going on, that is something which we don't provide, because there are a lot of things. If someone is sharing their screen, someone is sharing the data, that data we cannot access.

1106
02:26:07.350 --> 02:26:14.250
Vishal Singh: Maybe not with this, may not be with this bootcamp, with any other year program, maybe under AIPro or something you have.

1107
02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:19.369
Monal Kumar: Life support on the projects that you are building?

1108
02:26:19.650 --> 02:26:21.830
Vishal Singh: No, no, no, no, you are building, I can work.

1109
02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:36.560
Monal Kumar: Okay, so see, that project itself that we are coming, that is based on the domain itself, okay? You will see some domains on the ad tech, ad tech, healthcare, there are a lot of domains that the project is already being created on. So, there we have domain-specific projects.

1110
02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:37.680
Monal Kumar: Okay?

1111
02:26:37.770 --> 02:26:48.989
Monal Kumar: So, there you will find domain-specific projects. In the computer vision, we are already uploading some projects based on this analytics, vehicle analytics, and other things. So, that also you will see there. Okay?

1112
02:26:49.080 --> 02:27:05.029
Monal Kumar: how to track something and other things that is also present, but those comes in the project part. But the domain-specific learning, if you say, the projects that we are… here, we are going to create a project that is being di… that everyone can digest and can start their career with. As you can see, this is a generic, all…

1113
02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:07.890
Monal Kumar: The data science part of this course, right?

1114
02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:25.900
Monal Kumar: So here, we will be creating those, not the ones which is… because, getting a hands-on on the data and the industry data is pretty hard. If I can get… if we can get hands on those data, which is, again, backed by the NDS, which we cannot get, if we can get those, we can create those projects, alright?

1115
02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:26.290
Vishal Singh: Oh my goodness.

1116
02:27:26.290 --> 02:27:30.560
Monal Kumar: But for now, yes, we will be doing everything which is open source.

1117
02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:42.950
Vishal Singh: Okay, so through all this course of time for the one year, so, okay, let's say you're not going to provide the domino specific, but if I want to build something and where I seek some support on how to do it… Yes, it will help you.

1118
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:43.800
Monal Kumar: They will help you.

1119
02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:44.480
Vishal Singh: Yes.

1120
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:46.300
Monal Kumar: We will help guide you, okay?

1121
02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:46.959
Vishal Singh: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
02:27:46.960 --> 02:28:04.160
Monal Kumar: If you are stuck here, that these are the few steps you should be trying. I already do that on my LinkedIn. If people are stuck somewhere, I provide them three different steps, then what I want in return is that they will be doing all of those stuff, and tell me what are the reports of it, what are the things, whether they went well, then we will try something else.

1123
02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.229
Monal Kumar: So that's how things will go. Sure.

1124
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:07.149
Vishal Singh: Okay, nope.

1125
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:07.720
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1126
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:16.400
Vishal Singh: And one… one… the last question is that, like, the mod are on the parallel path, so what is the… if there is a conflict between the timings of the… your sessions?

1127
02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:30.200
Monal Kumar: Okay, see, conflicts will be there, but that's where the recordings will come in, alright? If you're not able to attend, you have to prioritize. If two courses are going in parallel, you have to prioritize which one you want.

1128
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:44.079
Monal Kumar: For the… for now, and later, once the recording is available, you can watch that. Plus, conflicts will be available. This batch is meant for people who are from beginner, and they want to go all the way to intermediate and advanced. But other… other courses are for advanced. We are beginners, we are not going to join.

1129
02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:51.730
Monal Kumar: So, if you're already an advanced user of some technology, obviously you will see some kind of conflict in our courses.

1130
02:28:51.730 --> 02:28:52.920
Vishal Singh: Okay, thank you.

1131
02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:54.080
Monal Kumar: Don't she understands that?

1132
02:28:55.420 --> 02:29:04.330
Monal Kumar: Okay, anyone, guys, anyone who is from a different time zone, they want to raise their hand, I will answer their query first.

1133
02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:07.189
Monal Kumar: Okay, let me go with Ankur.

1134
02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:09.440
Monal Kumar: Ankur?

1135
02:29:09.610 --> 02:29:11.849
Monal Kumar: And Komal after uncle.

1136
02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:17.910
Ankur Sharma: Yeah, hi, Krish. Hi, Manal. Hello. Good morning to you, and first of all, thanks a lot for this session.

1137
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:36.030
Ankur Sharma: So, there are two queries from my side. Actually, I am a part of a production support team, and I'm leading, the team, and having a total experience of around 18 years, okay? So, as of now, the company is actually focusing on the AI, and they want us to use

1138
02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:37.010
Ankur Sharma: Ugh.

1139
02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:51.839
Ankur Sharma: Agentic AI and all those generative AIs in order to automate the processes so that we can use, or we can increase the efficiency of the team. So, thanks to the Krish videos, I just went through those, and…

1140
02:29:51.840 --> 02:30:05.210
Ankur Sharma: I've been able to know about the Langchain, MCP, so I've already explored all of those, and also using them in our projects. But now, I'm a little bit confused that whether I should go with this

1141
02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:10.379
Ankur Sharma: course, or the other course which you're talking about with respect to the generative value.

1142
02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:18.860
Monal Kumar: What is your goal, actually? Solving problem on the generative AI, or solving problem for all the things?

1143
02:30:19.690 --> 02:30:22.589
Ankur Sharma: Solving problems with respect to the production support.

1144
02:30:23.020 --> 02:30:25.680
Monal Kumar: Production support, what we do in production support.

1145
02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:33.589
Ankur Sharma: So, production support means that we are actually supporting the production systems, so whenever there's a particular issue happening on a particular application.

1146
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.950
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1147
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:46.130
Ankur Sharma: and we normally debug them. But apart from that, we have the service requests, we have the other processes also, which can be automated with the help of the Agentech AI. So, this is the requirement from the management, from our team.

1148
02:30:46.130 --> 02:30:53.820
Monal Kumar: Right now, do you want to stay where you are right now, or do you want to move forward? What is your future goal? Not the current solution. What is your future goal?

1149
02:30:54.930 --> 02:31:00.620
Ankur Sharma: Future goal is to use AI, as efficiently as possible, but.

1150
02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:14.749
Monal Kumar: yes, then you have to become kind of an engineer in AI that will be able to do everything and learn parallelly this RAG and other things. Because that is the technology, the RAG and agentic is a technology which is… keeps on changing, new things is coming.

1151
02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:26.929
Monal Kumar: But if I talk about machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, NLP, the traditional, ways, those are pretty constant. So, the problem statement that can be solved with those cannot be solved with GenDK and Genetic AI.

1152
02:31:27.780 --> 02:31:42.510
Monal Kumar: Okay? So if you want to be an all-rounder, then you are already in a good place, okay? And and you can learn things in parallel, that I will suggest. But if you want only to solve the generative part and agentic part, then this might be a lot of things.

1153
02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:45.450
Monal Kumar: Here, you might learn a lot of things, but not…

1154
02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:50.559
Monal Kumar: If you want to go in-depth, Generative by NGK is the one you should select.

1155
02:31:51.530 --> 02:31:53.360
Ankur Sharma: Okay, and that is also a linear course?

1156
02:31:53.960 --> 02:31:56.179
Monal Kumar: No, no, no, that is 5 to 6 months.

1157
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:57.010
Ankur Sharma: part to.

1158
02:31:57.010 --> 02:31:59.730
Monal Kumar: But that is an advanced one, yeah, that is an advanced one, yes.

1159
02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:09.620
Ankur Sharma: Okay, because I know Python and… but not much about the deep learning part, so I was… that's why I was a little bit confused. Whether I should go with this one-year course, or the other one.

1160
02:32:10.090 --> 02:32:29.229
Monal Kumar: Yes, you can… see, if you don't think that you don't have the base, and if you want to learn other things, if you have the bandwidth, I would suggest, as Krishna mentioned, go with all, okay? Go with all the methods at once. Find some time and do that. But if you only want to solve those generative AI, as I mentioned, that is a different path which you should select.

1161
02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:31.840
Ankur Sharma: Okay, that would be sure. Okay, thanks.

1162
02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:33.050
Monal Kumar: Cool.

1163
02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:35.529
Monal Kumar: Hariharan, you are next.

1164
02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:40.660
Hariharan P: Hello.

1165
02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:42.410
Monal Kumar: Sorry about that. Yes, yes.

1166
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:44.869
Hariharan P: Hey, hi. Thank you.

1167
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:45.780
Monal Kumar: Eddie, yes.

1168
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:48.569
Hariharan P: Thank you, Christian Monald.

1169
02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:55.610
Hariharan P: First of all, thank you. I see… both of you are very enthusiastic and motivated.

1170
02:32:55.890 --> 02:32:59.930
Hariharan P: Just wanted to give you, my background,

1171
02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:02.450
Hariharan P: Close to two decades in IT.

1172
02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:09.290
Hariharan P: And the primary reason I had opted for this course is twofold. One is…

1173
02:33:10.060 --> 02:33:13.410
Hariharan P: Personally, I want to get the basics right.

1174
02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:21.429
Hariharan P: So that's where I was… I know a lot of people had asked this question, but I still wanted to ask once more, if you don't mind, kindly.

1175
02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:23.660
Hariharan P: You're able to hear me, right?

1176
02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:24.740
Monal Kumar: Yes, I can hear you.

1177
02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:36.579
Hariharan P: Yeah. So, you spoke about traditional route, and then you spoke about advanced route. So, does the advanced route cover all the aspects, what is there in traditional route in a shorter period of time, or it is…

1178
02:33:36.580 --> 02:33:39.889
Monal Kumar: No, no, no. It skips it. It skips it.

1179
02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:40.820
Hariharan P: Okay.

1180
02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:55.930
Monal Kumar: Okay? It's scripture, because machine… as I mentioned, machine learning, statistics solves a different kind of a problem, okay? Okay, okay. So, if those problems you think that you will not encounter, or you don't want to solve, or you want to go in that direction.

1181
02:33:55.930 --> 02:34:06.320
Monal Kumar: then directly jump from the generative AI part of it. But if you think that you should be doing that, then you should do this path, yeah.

1182
02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:17.820
Hariharan P: Okay. No, that's our, see, my personal goal is to learn everything, detail. That's number one. Number two, I am in a position my…

1183
02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:21.480
Hariharan P: career position, I have to…

1184
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:29.080
Hariharan P: implement a few of these, right? As we speak, right? I'm… I'm working with my team.

1185
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:31.000
Hariharan P: So,

1186
02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:37.360
Hariharan P: Considering both those aspects, what do you suggest? I know it's a tricky question to answer, but if you can…

1187
02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:40.599
Monal Kumar: Your handling team and?

1188
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:46.480
Hariharan P: and we have to call out a few use cases for implementing.

1189
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:51.260
Monal Kumar: Okay, okay, so that ideas to lead to management, right?

1190
02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:51.910
Hariharan P: Yes, yes.

1191
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:53.699
Monal Kumar: Alright, so…

1192
02:34:53.700 --> 02:35:02.699
Hariharan P: I manage a client where we are embarking on, you know, AI-based, you know, use cases that we have to implement.

1193
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:07.750
Hariharan P: That is on the, on the role that I do, but my personal goal is to learn

1194
02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:14.490
Hariharan P: Everything in a nice way, particularly around data science and AIML.

1195
02:35:14.810 --> 02:35:20.860
Hariharan P: So, do you think I should continue with this, or should I skip to the advanced route?

1196
02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:26.499
Monal Kumar: See, I… okay, does your position require you to write code as well?

1197
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:31.449
Monal Kumar: Write code, and provide the exact solution, or the solution is something

1198
02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:33.999
Monal Kumar: You can transfer to your.

1199
02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:40.730
Hariharan P: No, I… I'm primarily, I'm primarily, into, delivery, so…

1200
02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:56.359
Monal Kumar: You're primarily into delivery, right? So I think learning things from the base is good, but what you need is because a lot of the, because management is going to accept only the problem statement that clients are interested in, that is in Generative and agent decay right now, right?

1201
02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:03.119
Monal Kumar: So, those things, that is not directly a target for the first few months.

1202
02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:18.519
Monal Kumar: But, you can… we will be targeting those also after 5-6 months, alright? The part of Generative and others. But if you… if you think that you don't want to invest all of those times also, the first initial phase of the base, then you can directly jump to the Generate TBI part of it.

1203
02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:21.300
Hariharan P: When you say generative, it is the modern route you're talking.

1204
02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:23.249
Monal Kumar: Modern route, modern route, yes.

1205
02:36:23.250 --> 02:36:29.590
Hariharan P: Okay, so, just a question. So, is it, is it possible to continue both, or,

1206
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:45.850
Monal Kumar: It is possible to continue both, see, based on your bandwidth, because I'm not sure how much time you can invest, but if you think that sometimes you want to learn Python, you can join this particular course for one month, for one and a half months, whatever time we are going to require for the Python.

1207
02:36:45.850 --> 02:37:00.949
Monal Kumar: Then, if you think that in the meantime, I don't want to learn SQL because of these things I already know, I don't want to learn X topic, because that is something I know, you can skip those and jump to the other parallel class and watch those recordings. So, if you… you can create your own, different time zones.

1208
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:07.020
Hariharan P: So, if I am right, the traditional route covers the modern route also after a few months, is that correct?

1209
02:37:07.020 --> 02:37:08.460
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes.

1210
02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:13.530
Hariharan P: Okay, and advanced route, you… it says all three in parallel.

1211
02:37:13.530 --> 02:37:28.450
Monal Kumar: Advanced, yes, yes. In parallel means the same thing. You're doing the traditional, but while you're doing the traditional, that is the basic part, the core component of it, you're also learning the generative AI parallelly, the generative AI component, design tech and other things.

1212
02:37:28.450 --> 02:37:34.319
Hariharan P: Okay, but that means I have to enroll in all the three courses to do the traditional route and modern.

1213
02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:36.759
Monal Kumar: Two different routes. Third is…

1214
02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:41.070
Monal Kumar: Combining all the two different routes, and doing something extra there.

1215
02:37:41.350 --> 02:37:46.620
Monal Kumar: So it does not require a new course, but it requires two different paths to be combined into the last one.

1216
02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:55.630
Hariharan P: Sorry, that's why I'm… I didn't understand. So, if I have to do the third one, advanced route, I have to enroll in traditional and modern, is that what you're saying?

1217
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:57.470
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1218
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:58.570
Hariharan P: Oh, okay.

1219
02:37:58.570 --> 02:38:07.739
Monal Kumar: Because modern also covers the part of a senior engineer, where you're learning things in details and training it, alright? But, yeah, you can…

1220
02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:10.039
Hariharan P: The last, the, sorry, little more…

1221
02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:11.799
Monal Kumar: No, no, it's fine, it's fine, yes.

1222
02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:18.159
Hariharan P: There you have said, in modern route, you said learn DS fundamentals. That is Data Science Fundamentals, or data structures fundamentals.

1223
02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:21.830
Monal Kumar: That is… okay. Is it DS Fundamentals?

1224
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:30.450
Monal Kumar: Yeah, it is DS, it is written as DS. Yes, Learn DS Fundamentals is the Data Science Fundamentals. That is the base part, see, that is the last part of that modern route.

1225
02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:31.900
Monal Kumar: Can you see there?

1226
02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:39.000
Monal Kumar: So, clearing the concepts, the base of it is the last part in the modern route, but in the traditional route, that is the first part.

1227
02:38:39.890 --> 02:38:44.140
Monal Kumar: Okay, okay. So, there, the priority is different.

1228
02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:48.560
Hariharan P: So I can talk to your counselor more on the modern route, is that correct?

1229
02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:50.240
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1230
02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:58.390
Monal Kumar: That I am already enrolled in this one, but I also want to go to the generative part of it. And you can talk to our team?

1231
02:38:58.390 --> 02:38:58.900
Hariharan P: Cut.

1232
02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:07.649
Hariharan P: Sure, okay, but what happens, like, the traditional route will cover the same generative AI after some months, right? Is that correct?

1233
02:39:07.650 --> 02:39:08.730
Monal Kumar: But, see, it depends.

1234
02:39:08.730 --> 02:39:11.140
Hariharan P: It will be overlap. It will be overlap.

1235
02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:30.660
Monal Kumar: be one-to-one overlap. This particular course, the Ultimate Data Science, covers things from the beginner to intermediate and advanced. But those courses that we have are intermediate to advanced plus plus, whatever you can think of, okay? So, those go in the depth that we have, but those goes in more depth, what we are going to teach here.

1236
02:39:31.050 --> 02:39:38.050
Monal Kumar: Those are specialized… specializations of generative AI. Here, we are going to touch the generative AI and get ready for the specialization.

1237
02:39:38.610 --> 02:39:46.389
Hariharan P: Got it. Thank you, thank you. And, while doing this course, do you recommend learning any books on the site, like the.

1238
02:39:46.390 --> 02:39:52.759
Monal Kumar: See, books, for me, different types of people, right? For me, whenever I see a book, I feel sleepy.

1239
02:39:52.760 --> 02:40:10.169
Monal Kumar: But there are other people who can complete the book in 7 days. So if you think you can complete the book in 7 days or 14 days, but if you are someone who can complete the book in 6 months, I will not recommend it. So if you're a fast learner from book, go with that, because books provide you also good knowledge, good exposure to depth and different architectures.

1240
02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:13.440
Hariharan P: Yeah, I meant, complementing this course, should I…

1241
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:13.940
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1242
02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:15.839
Hariharan P: Any, any other books as well?

1243
02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:21.860
Monal Kumar: We will usually provide more depth than the books, okay? This is what I have seen, yeah.

1244
02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:26.399
Hariharan P: Okay, thank you. And then, probably the last question…

1245
02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:26.870
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

1246
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:45.990
Hariharan P: So, see, do you have… see, there is… there is so much of things happening in the IT at the moment on AI, right? A lot of people are talking about AI, but I don't see if you are embarking on identifying whether a particular use case is a real,

1247
02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:48.749
Monal Kumar: AIML use case.

1248
02:40:48.750 --> 02:40:50.660
Hariharan P: It is a very tricky scenario, right?

1249
02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:56.789
Monal Kumar: It is tricky when you don't know what each tech or subset solves it, yes?

1250
02:40:56.790 --> 02:41:06.460
Hariharan P: Correct, correct. So, there is a… there is a very, there… there can be hybrid models also. It can be partly automated, partly AI, right? So…

1251
02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:08.110
Monal Kumar: Yes, it always happens.

1252
02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:19.050
Hariharan P: Yeah, so what I'm looking at is, I know it's too early in this course to ask you, but since I've enrolled in this, do you have any suggestion or framework which I can go through to

1253
02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:25.280
Hariharan P: find out if I choose a use case, whether it's really an AI use case or not. Do you have anything around that?

1254
02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:43.789
Monal Kumar: See, for that, you have to become an engineer, okay? That engineer in terms of the AI part of it, because we as AI engineers, and I personally do software development as well, so I'm not… I don't always rely on AI. I always rely on the solution, which I can also build just from the traditional software development, okay?

1255
02:41:43.980 --> 02:42:00.609
Monal Kumar: So, if you know best of the both worlds, then only you'll be… this is what a senior person does. You cannot expect this particular thing which you are asking, right, from a junior or a mid-senior person. Only a senior level or architect level will be able to tell you, okay.

1256
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:11.100
Monal Kumar: AI can solve it, but can it be solved with some other method which has less latency, less overall cost, less overall maintenance? If yes, then don't use AI.

1257
02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:22.750
Monal Kumar: But if AI is, in long term, providing us a better solution, then go with AI. It might be possible that two, two technologies will solve the same… can solve the same problem.

1258
02:42:22.750 --> 02:42:27.680
Monal Kumar: But again, do a lot of testing to find out which one is the best. So, that's how we.

1259
02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:40.800
Hariharan P: But for, but for, just as a novice, question, right? Yes, sure. So, to solve a AI use case, is it important to have, you know, the data, data, data is very important.

1260
02:42:41.010 --> 02:42:42.959
Monal Kumar: Depends on what AI we are building.

1261
02:42:43.280 --> 02:43:02.119
Monal Kumar: There are different kinds of AI. Machine learning is also… creates an AI. Based on machine learning, you do a lot of decision. If you combine machine learning with software engineering, that can also create AI. A lot of people confuse AI with chat GPT. ChatGPT is a kind of AI, generative part of AI. There are different kinds of AI which you build. Based on the problem statement.

1262
02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:06.510
Monal Kumar: Some might require data, some might require examples, some might require a lot of data.

1263
02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:10.030
Monal Kumar: So, yeah, it depends solely on the problem statement.

1264
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:11.530
Hariharan P: Okay.

1265
02:43:12.140 --> 02:43:14.950
Hariharan P: Thank you, thanks a lot, thank you very much.

1266
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:16.539
Monal Kumar: Sure, sure, honey. Yes.

1267
02:43:16.770 --> 02:43:32.490
Monal Kumar: Alright, guys, I'm giving, 5 minutes break, okay? I will drink some water, and in the… and after that, we will start the next part. That is, again, the discussion, alright? Queries. So, let me start a timer, and then I will be back.

1268
02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:34.439
Monal Kumar: Is that fine with everyone?

1269
02:43:36.270 --> 02:43:37.220
Monal Kumar: Yes?

1270
02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:44.930
Monal Kumar: Great. Okay, I'm starting a timer, you guys will also be able to see the same timer.

1271
02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:47.790
Monal Kumar: So, see you after some time.

1272
02:49:07.220 --> 02:49:13.640
Monal Kumar: Alright, so we are back. I hope everyone is here. Guys, are we here? Confirm yes.

1273
02:49:15.310 --> 02:49:16.130
Monal Kumar: Great.

1274
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.950
Monal Kumar: Right?

1275
02:49:18.450 --> 02:49:23.849
Monal Kumar: So… Just want to confirm one thing.

1276
02:49:24.290 --> 02:49:26.239
Monal Kumar: So, give me a second…

1277
02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:47.830
Monal Kumar: Okay, debug.

1278
02:49:51.570 --> 02:49:53.689
Monal Kumar: No debug, that does not… okay.

1279
02:49:53.830 --> 02:49:56.629
Monal Kumar: Okay, so guys, our…

1280
02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:23.379
Monal Kumar: Guys, we have Meng from our team.

1281
02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:28.679
Monal Kumar: And, I want to say something? I want to show us something.

1282
02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:30.589
Monal Kumar: That'll look pretty amazing? Yes.

1283
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:34.249
Mayank: Hey everyone, I hope you're able to see me, see me fine.

1284
02:50:34.930 --> 02:50:42.339
Mayank: And also, hear me as well. Just wanna let me change my name quickly, because I think, my name is also Kresh, so let me change it.

1285
02:50:43.410 --> 02:50:49.150
Mayank: Yeah, great everyone. I hope all of you are able to, like, see me properly, yes or no?

1286
02:50:51.460 --> 02:51:08.430
Mayank: Great, great, great. Cool. So, great everyone, I'm pretty sure that you're having a very, very good learning time. I would just like to show you one big thing which he was working on the last, 7-8 months or so. Basically, him, Krishna, and the whole team. So, just let me share my screen, and let me know once you're able to see it.

1287
02:51:09.890 --> 02:51:12.199
Mayank: I hope my screen is visible, everyone.

1288
02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:13.729
Mayank: Yes or no?

1289
02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:14.390
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1290
02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:15.730
Mayank: Great.

1291
02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:28.659
Mayank: So, yeah, this is actually the platform which we have built everyone now in this. What I would like to do, just a minute, let me just show you why and do one thing. Let me go to TLDRAW to just…

1292
02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:31.890
Mayank: Kind of.

1293
02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:43.640
Mayank: discuss all of you, like, what it does, because, yeah, we will be giving free access to, like, 1DP access, not free, but yes. So, whenever we talk about, let's say, as a student, or as a learner, right?

1294
02:51:44.170 --> 02:51:46.750
Mayank: Now, let me take this percent.

1295
02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:48.500
Mayank: Just a second, yeah.

1296
02:51:48.710 --> 02:52:05.610
Mayank: See, let's say this is you in your journey where you are a learner or you are a student. Now, of course, along with making sure that you are learning each and everything in depth, which I'm pretty sure in this course you are doing, okay, there are, of course, few more things which you have to take care of. The same starts from, let's say, creating your resume.

1297
02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:09.350
Mayank: So… let me make it even smaller.

1298
02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:13.440
Mayank: I think now this is better as small student.

1299
02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:15.030
Mayank: Sweet.

1300
02:52:15.150 --> 02:52:16.070
Mayank: all…

1301
02:52:16.430 --> 02:52:34.900
Mayank: all of you are, like, I'm pretty sure, having a very, very nice time learning about things, okay? So now, once your learning is… kind of will begin, there will be many different other things which you will have to also handle. Now, for the same few things which I always say, is that resume is very, very important, everyone, right? Then, along with resume, we have to make sure

1302
02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:42.580
Mayank: that we are also giving interviews as well, right? So, interviews are a very, very important part of

1303
02:52:42.690 --> 02:52:46.830
Mayank: Your journey in, let's say, your professional journey, okay?

1304
02:52:46.930 --> 02:52:49.780
Mayank: Similarly, many times, we have to create our portfolio.

1305
02:52:50.050 --> 02:52:52.070
Mayank: So, portfolio creation.

1306
02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:57.899
Mayank: Making sure that if you want to share our projects, share anything about us, that all is kind of also taken care of.

1307
02:52:58.030 --> 02:53:02.060
Mayank: And of course, along with that, many times we need some roadmaps, etc, right?

1308
02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:15.109
Mayank: roadmaps, etc, which you would need that, okay, they are tailored for you all specifically. And yes, many of you will be having the doubts as well. Now, for the same, we have created this platform, everyone, so I hope all of you are able to see this platform.

1309
02:53:16.430 --> 02:53:23.259
Mayank: AI mentor for Interview Preparation, AI resumer Builder. Are you all able to see my… see on my screen? Platforms and everything, yes or no?

1310
02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:25.790
Mayank: Agreed.

1311
02:53:25.940 --> 02:53:39.310
Mayank: Now, what we have to do, everyone, so this is, like, almost complete in development, but since all of you are starting with this new course, we thought that it will be very great, and we will be… we would like rather love to provide access to all of you, okay?

1312
02:53:39.370 --> 02:53:46.789
Mayank: Now, for the same, first, let me show the features quickly. Now, if you will just log in, so let me just show you by, let's say, logging out once.

1313
02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:53.489
Mayank: I will just go to this website, everyone, so all of you can also access it, it's properly live on production.

1314
02:53:53.760 --> 02:53:56.860
Mayank: If you click on sign up, and let's say you continue with Google.

1315
02:53:57.290 --> 02:53:59.290
Mayank: Then I could just select my email account here.

1316
02:54:00.130 --> 02:54:03.240
Mayank: So, as you can see, my email account has been selected, everyone.

1317
02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:05.870
Mayank: And I will see a overall

1318
02:54:06.180 --> 02:54:12.030
Mayank: UI like this. So, how many of you are able to see this UI? I hope you're liking the UI as well, everyone, yes or no?

1319
02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:15.460
Mayank: Can I get a yes, thumbs up, or something in the chat?

1320
02:54:18.910 --> 02:54:29.220
Mayank: So, let me show you the features one by one, everyone, because I feel the same will be very, very important. And just, excuse my voice, might be a little bit, I think I'm a little bit under the code, so, okay. So, great.

1321
02:54:29.220 --> 02:54:44.629
Mayank: So, I will just tell you the overall mindset, everyone. We thought that, yes, we are already taking care of students, we are teaching them things from scratch, and all the mentors, everyone is kind of putting in a lot of efforts. We want to now make sure that we are also providing a proper ecosystem

1322
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:54.939
Mayank: Where we can do other things as well. So, when I talk about, let's say, these all resumes, interviews, portfolio, roadmaps, all these are also the things which each and every student

1323
02:54:55.110 --> 02:55:06.859
Mayank: will surely require in their professional journey, whether you are changing jobs, whether you are trying out something. So, all of these things, of course, are required. And I think this is what helps and completes the circles, finally.

1324
02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:17.279
Mayank: Where you are very much confident that you can get the job and everything, okay? Now, if I go back to our platform, this is actually what this platform is doing, everyone. So, if you will see the same right in front of you.

1325
02:55:17.610 --> 02:55:29.930
Mayank: It is having AI interviews, so this is where, again, the full homepage, where we will be having the AI news as well soon, so we have actually kind of created this as well. Now, when you go on AI interviews, everyone, pay attention.

1326
02:55:30.170 --> 02:55:33.069
Mayank: You can go to, let's say, topic-wise interviews.

1327
02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:39.410
Mayank: And you can see that there are so many interviews which you can directly give. So, when we talk about agentic AI,

1328
02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:45.460
Mayank: All the interviews are there. If you talk about, let's say, machine learning, you will be learning machine learning in some time, right?

1329
02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:52.920
Mayank: Then there is deep learning, NLP, computer vision, data engineering, system design, all of these things are present here.

1330
02:55:53.250 --> 02:56:01.690
Mayank: Now, along with the same, everyone, how many of you want to work at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, any of these companies? Can I get a thumbs up or something?

1331
02:56:02.910 --> 02:56:09.890
Mayank: Right? Now, many of you will be aware that what happened is that, of course, you can give their interviews, everyone wants to work there.

1332
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:27.400
Mayank: But there are many people who are easily able to get the rounds. Like, if I… if you talk about me, I have given rounds at all of these companies. I know that Amazon asked leadership-based question. Google has a Googliness round. Okay, Microsoft, the question are based on lots of computer fundamental things as well.

1333
02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:32.559
Mayank: So here, what we have done, everyone, if you will go on these Explore Companies.

1334
02:56:32.750 --> 02:56:35.860
Mayank: We have made sure that we have scraped the whole web.

1335
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:49.930
Mayank: And try to also add a structure to these companies' interviews. Now, we will be adding more companies as well, service-based startups, okay, corporations, all these big tech giants as well. But, just as an example, if you go on Amazon.

1336
02:56:49.930 --> 02:56:59.789
Mayank: This is what a typical Amazon interview process is. You have a technical interview round, then technical interview 2, then system design, leadership principle, and last, the bar litzer interview.

1337
02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:10.780
Mayank: Any of your friend, if he has given this round, he will be aware. So, what we have done here, that you can come here and quickly test out the same. So, if you, let's say, just test out this thing, everyone, I will just give the access.

1338
02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:19.500
Mayank: And my face and everything will be taken, because this is, again, I think I have to change my camera, multiple cameras, yeah. I can click on Start Interview Session.

1339
02:57:19.610 --> 02:57:21.949
Mayank: And the interview will begin. So, see?

1340
02:57:22.290 --> 02:57:24.390
Mayank: It is just telling you each and everything.

1341
02:57:27.410 --> 02:57:37.170
Mayank: This is a proper thing which tested. See, if I'm seeing on the camera, it will increase attention positivity. The second I look away, because I have a screen.

1342
02:57:37.250 --> 02:57:46.199
Mayank: it will start falling. So it's totally real-time, having all the things. It is asking you the question as well. You can speak the answer to the question. It is basically making sure that it is asking the right question.

1343
02:57:46.250 --> 02:58:02.209
Mayank: It is having the interview agenda as well, so as to help you. The second you look away, it will fall down. So, it is making sure that, yes, you are having a real-time experience. The question will be based on your answers. It's a proper, well-tested, well-researched AI interview.

1344
02:58:02.530 --> 02:58:15.170
Mayank: Okay, of course, you can change the theme, etc. as well. And once you are completed, okay, so I think it will… okay, let me just end it, because, of course, I… I want all of you to give that, not me.

1345
02:58:15.170 --> 02:58:23.139
Mayank: See? We will be able to, in some time, get the report as well. Now, I have just completed this in a minute or something, so report, of course, is not available.

1346
02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:40.830
Mayank: But yes, along with that, if you will see, we have made sure that all the different, different kinds of interviews, with respect to company-specific, with respect to topic-wise, with respect to a full-length AI interview as well, so this is based on your own CV. So, for example, in this, I will have to select my resume.

1347
02:58:41.130 --> 02:58:58.390
Mayank: Now, once I select my resumes, the question will be based on my resume, so it will ask me, hey, why did you leave your job at Goldman? Why did you… how… what was the biggest challenge in your field? All these things are present. Now, to take it a step further, all of you will be starting with data science from the next class, yes or no?

1348
02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:06.449
Mayank: All of you will be starting from data science, right? So, see, there are tracks as well. So, if you go on tracks, machine learning, deep learning.

1349
02:59:06.830 --> 02:59:11.429
Mayank: NLP, computer vision, all of these things are there. Select a track.

1350
02:59:11.550 --> 02:59:13.740
Mayank: Which you want to master and get started, see?

1351
02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:17.189
Mayank: All the agendas, all of these different, different things are present.

1352
02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:21.050
Mayank: And once you complete the track, you will be having

1353
02:59:21.210 --> 02:59:25.680
Mayank: All of the questions which are normally asked, both in interviews and in work.

1354
02:59:25.970 --> 02:59:28.880
Mayank: And pay attention how many different, different tags we have created.

1355
02:59:30.070 --> 02:59:39.699
Mayank: Right? Database system, blockchain, and these are all the ones which are actually helpful in your professional journey. Okay? So, this is all around the interview, everyone. Do you like this feature? Yes or no?

1356
02:59:42.050 --> 02:59:43.550
Mayank: Do you like this interview thing?

1357
02:59:43.650 --> 02:59:45.220
Mayank: Would you like to get access to it?

1358
02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:54.540
Mayank: Great. So, now, the next thing comes FT1, where it is on the resume building. So, yeah, see? The resume building part.

1359
02:59:55.270 --> 02:59:58.390
Mayank: How many of you want to create your very, very great resume?

1360
02:59:59.820 --> 03:00:17.400
Mayank: And you go to ChatGPT or Gemini or somewhere else and just paste your things and everything. Well, we have taken that part also, everyone, so what we will be doing is, there is a resume builder where you can create your resume from scratch. You can upload your resume as well, so if you have already created a resume, we will take the heavy lifting, okay?

1361
03:00:17.570 --> 03:00:36.620
Mayank: Or you can go to your LinkedIn as well. So, see, there are steps where you can also get the LinkedIn thing and just upload your LinkedIn file, the LinkedIn PDF which you get, and all of those things will be very nicely created into your resume. So, just as an example, I will show you. Either you can start from complete scratch, everyone, as you can see in front of you. So, see, everything is kind of very nicely defined.

1362
03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:48.750
Mayank: And the best part is that either you can start fresh, or you can upload your own resume as well, but what I would like to show you is, just, let's say if I go, at a particular thing.

1363
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:54.970
Mayank: This is all integrated with AI. So, very nicely, it will suggest us each and everything, see?

1364
03:00:55.150 --> 03:01:06.429
Mayank: I could just select, choose all of these things, okay, and I could add them as well. Similarly, I could go on a project, let's say I go on project, and just, let's say I mention EvolveView. Then let's say these are the technologies.

1365
03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:09.320
Mayank: Then, let's say it is 2026.

1366
03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:12.480
Mayank: Say, 2026 only?

1367
03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:15.089
Mayank: And project link, I'm not adding.

1368
03:01:15.350 --> 03:01:24.929
Mayank: just let me give some description, okay? So it will just first try to come up with something, because it is very well AI-linked, and as it does, you will see that how it is coming, right? I will create quickly, just…

1369
03:01:25.290 --> 03:01:30.850

So, all of those things are very, very easily available to all of you, everyone. Now, similarly, you can add your skills, certification, honors and awards, all of these things will be done. Now, see, the second I clicked on skill, it checked what all I have added, and added the skills right in front of me.

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:50.749
Mayank: And in this, what I would like to do, let me go to iCloud and see my drive, my NSUMA.

03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:02.909
Mayank: So now, even I have to don't fill in, and I can just edit things out here.

1451
03:11:03.130 --> 03:11:08.030
Mayank: So I hope all of you are able to see this. And don't worry, you don't have to, like, for people who have made a payment, it's just 1 rupees.

1452
03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:12.520
Mayank: For people who have not, we are increasing the limit from the backend only, directly. Okay?

1453
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:14.770
Mayank: Clear?

1454
03:11:17.250 --> 03:11:19.099
Mayank: Sign up is only through Gmail, yes.

1455
03:11:23.930 --> 03:11:24.740
Mayank: Great.

1456
03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:30.740
Mayank: So, yes, everyone, I hope you're able to see this feature. How is this feature? Where you can just select your already existing resume as well.

1457
03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:34.370
Mayank: And once you have that, you can go and maybe make any edits.

1458
03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:40.550
Mayank: So, see, each and everything, all the projects, and it is very, very much in compliance with the ATS as well.

1459
03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:45.179
Mayank: Right? Every one of my screen is shared, please check your internet. Everyone, are you able to see my screen?

1460
03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:52.870
Mayank: Don't worry, everyone, don't apply the coupon, we are giving the access free only, so once you come and sign up, you will be able to get the access for free.

1461
03:11:54.740 --> 03:11:55.680
Mayank: Okay?

1462
03:11:56.010 --> 03:11:57.830
Mayank: All of you will be giving the excess.

1463
03:11:57.980 --> 03:12:05.439
Mayank: Great. So now, once you get the access and this, everyone, I hope you're able to understand that as you interview and the resume filter feature, yes or no?

1464
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:09.409
Mayank: Interview and the resume builder feature, right?

1465
03:12:10.090 --> 03:12:10.860
Mayank: Great.

1466
03:12:10.970 --> 03:12:27.100
Mayank: Next, you can also go on Career Roadmap. So, see, all of these roadmaps are created. I think many of you will be asking for the roadmaps for the questions. Well, of course, with that, also you can do here is you can go on My Roadmaps, and pay attention what I will do.

1467
03:12:27.230 --> 03:12:28.650
Mayank: I can create a new roadmap.

1468
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:31.000
Mayank: Let's say I can enter my name, Mayank.

1469
03:12:31.660 --> 03:12:35.799
Mayank: Then I could have, let's say, 3 to 5 years, sorry, 5 to 10 years of experience.

1470
03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:38.619
Mayank: I could select that, let's say I'm a senior developer.

1471
03:12:39.020 --> 03:12:52.889
Mayank: Then, let's say I select my, full-stack developer, which is basically where I want to plan. Now, what I could do, I could select the kind of company. So, these are all the questions which you go majorly get asked, right, everyone?

1472
03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:59.400
Mayank: Gobina, please make sure that you select on Zoom the second tab, or where a tab where my screen will be visible, okay?

1473
03:13:00.340 --> 03:13:03.310
Mayank: My screen is properly shared and it's usable.

1474
03:13:04.540 --> 03:13:19.050
Mayank: Now, you could select the company. So, many of you have this question, right, that I'm targeting this company, I'm targeting that company. Let's say I'm targeting man-level companies. I can click on continue. Then, 5 to 10 hours, let's say as an example, continue, and see, it is going to now ask me questions related to full-stack development.

1475
03:13:20.170 --> 03:13:29.620
Mayank: Now, I can select these questions up, pay attention. So, let's say in backend technologies I'm 7, in databases I'm 8, API integration, let's say I'm 9,

1476
03:13:29.820 --> 03:13:39.109
Mayank: deployment and dev of, let's say, 8, and I could generate a roadmap which is based on my answers. So this roadmap, everyone, which will get created.

1477
03:13:39.230 --> 03:13:41.149
Mayank: It will be created for me.

1478
03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:47.520
Mayank: Pay attention. So, now I'll just quickly load my, like, quickly, quickly just load my roadmap, okay?

1479
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:49.390
Mayank: So, let it just load.

1480
03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:50.330
Mayank: Si.

1481
03:13:50.860 --> 03:13:56.550
Mayank: It is a proper full-stack roadmap, which is for me, particularly And…

1482
03:13:56.850 --> 03:14:03.290
Mayank: This is where things get interesting. You can ask things as well, so you can just ask that, hey, explain me like I'm 5.

1483
03:14:03.430 --> 03:14:08.700
Mayank: So, these are all the things which you ask your chat GPT and everything, right? So, see? How nicely it has just…

1484
03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:15.650
Mayank: basically ask all the questions. You can select anything, and then also ask that, hey, ask about Step 2.

1485
03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:18.050
Mayank: You can say, again, summarize the topic.

1486
03:14:19.100 --> 03:14:21.010
Mayank: Now, I'll just summarize each and everything here.

1487
03:14:21.390 --> 03:14:23.169
Mayank: Go through the same and pay attention.

1488
03:14:24.270 --> 03:14:32.090
Mayank: sets of instructions, so all of these things, it will be explaining to you in a very easy-to manner, understand manner. Similarly, you can see the smart resources as well here.

1489
03:14:32.390 --> 03:14:38.330
Mayank: So these will be the interviews, these will be our courses, all of these different, different things you will get access to.

1490
03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:42.920
Mayank: In a similar manner, all of these things you can mark right here as well, so you can click on…

1491
03:14:43.090 --> 03:14:43.860
Mayank: Ben.

1492
03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:58.740
Mayank: So that you can also make sure that you are checking that, yes, these things are properly handled at your end. Right? That, okay, I have done this with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Now, along with that, let's say if I go around DevOps, and I click on Smart Resources.

1493
03:14:58.930 --> 03:15:02.159
Mayank: There's a video, DevOps vs. MLOps, on Crystal Channel.

1494
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:07.719
Mayank: Okay, so similarly, our other mentors channel will also pop up here. You can play the video right here only.

1495
03:15:08.490 --> 03:15:13.579
Mayank: And you can see that, okay, what is the difference? Then, there is a DevOps interview as well, which you can give.

1496
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:19.359
Mayank: Okay, so all of these things you are going to get. Now, we have increased the limit from backend.

1497
03:15:19.650 --> 03:15:23.850
Mayank: And then, based on all the activity you do, you will be getting the recommendations.

1498
03:15:24.450 --> 03:15:43.940
Mayank: As well as you will be having your own learning center as well, okay? So I think we have to increase the machine from backend, so no worries, see. All of these recommendations, it is just giving me because I've created MLOps, all these things. In the interview as well, it is going to give me system design and backend, because I selected full-stack Engineering.

1499
03:15:44.070 --> 03:15:48.560
Mayank: And on the YouTube part as well, like, it will suggest playlist after some time, once it gets to learn more about me.

1500
03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:56.030
Mayank: Then finally, everyone, is the Learning Center, so you can save the videos or the playlist here, once from the roadmap, and you will be able to see this.

1501
03:15:56.350 --> 03:15:59.510
Mayank: So, how's the platform, everyone? Did you enjoy the platform?

1502
03:15:59.900 --> 03:16:00.939
Mayank: Yes or no?

1503
03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:08.510
Mayank: Right? So, one more thing. Now, what happened is that many of you will be starting your journey.

1504
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:28.350
Mayank: And you will have to make sure that you can share, right? Share each and everything about your overall portfolio to some recruiters. Now, job feature is still in development, everyone, so we are working on that, so we can connect with companies directly, and we can help you with jobs. Now, what you can do, if you want to pay attention, if you go on my portfolio.

1505
03:16:29.050 --> 03:16:32.759
Mayank: Then you can create your life portfolio as well, okay?

1506
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:40.659
Mayank: Now, I could just import my resume. So, the resume which I created, let's say this resume, I could directly import it. So, create a resume with all the AI and everything.

1507
03:16:41.640 --> 03:16:44.610
Mayank: I could say an awesome developer.

1508
03:16:45.630 --> 03:16:48.439
Mayank: And, just, let's say if I save it…

1509
03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:57.519
Mayank: I could publish the same as well. So, see? The same has been published. And pay attention, everyone. Are all of you able to access this? Yes or no?

1510
03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:05.840
Mayank: Are all of you able to access my resume? Sorry, my… this… Portfolio.

1511
03:17:07.640 --> 03:17:08.500
Mayank: Right?

1512
03:17:08.910 --> 03:17:11.760
Mayank: So, I hope the same is nice now.

1513
03:17:12.380 --> 03:17:13.470
Mayank: Creative event?

1514
03:17:16.270 --> 03:17:20.099
Mayank: So, yeah. You can also have your image and everything as well.

1515
03:17:20.370 --> 03:17:36.409
Mayank: So you can create your own resume as well, and anytime, let's say, someone asks, you can view the same live as well, everyone. Like, how it will look. If anyone asks that, hey, share your, portfolio, you don't have to go anywhere, you can just share your portfolio here only. And then all of the learnings, everything you can update here.

1516
03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:44.459
Mayank: So, this is how your full platform will be, everyone. So, I think we have increased the free limits. So, if I just quickly show you what are the free limits…

1517
03:17:45.030 --> 03:17:46.929
Mayank: Let me actually go on home first.

1518
03:17:47.840 --> 03:17:52.890
Mayank: You can see, you have the portfolio, you have the interviews, all the resumes, you have the roadmap as well.

1519
03:17:53.210 --> 03:17:58.819
Mayank: You can try out any of these things. Add… there's a proper step-by-step thing as well.

1520
03:17:59.020 --> 03:18:15.930
Mayank: Okay? We can optimize that as you may, so we can go and click and make sure that as you may is optimized. All of these things are basically available at your disposal. So, Praman, you don't have to apply the promo code. Please, like, just have the… in the free only, we have had this thing, okay? So, everyone, do you like the platform?

1521
03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:18.430
Mayank: Do you like the platform?

1522
03:18:19.800 --> 03:18:25.910
Mayank: Right? So, what we have done is, we have given the access to free. Now, if anyone has paid 1 rupees as well, not a problem.

1523
03:18:26.190 --> 03:18:33.950
Mayank: Again, it's a simple 1 rupee. We will try if we can refund that as well. So, you only normally have these things, okay?

1524
03:18:34.150 --> 03:18:43.449
Mayank: I guess, just go hayward with this, like, try out all the platforms, try out getting our resumes. Each and everything is properly working. It will be having all these things, okay?

1525
03:18:44.180 --> 03:18:54.259
Mayank: So, as of now, we are giving it totally for free to all of you. For all of you, each and every one of you, this is totally for free. So, please make sure you take the advantage of this, okay?

1526
03:18:54.640 --> 03:18:58.570
Mayank: And yeah, I think that is the whole thing. So…

1527
03:18:59.370 --> 03:19:04.620
Mayank: Yeah, I guess everyone, not a problem. If anyone has any suggestions, just reach out to me on my email ID.

1528
03:19:05.450 --> 03:19:16.149
Mayank: Which I've given to all of you in the chat. Along with that, please connect with me, so I also make regular connect content on YouTube and LinkedIn. Pretty sure that many of you must have seen my content as well.

1529
03:19:16.430 --> 03:19:30.850
Mayank: So, go through that. It will not be charging you anything after one month, so don't worry, okay? You don't have to upgrade now. We are giving, we are giving more credits and everything to you, so that all these things, if you want subscription, pay attention.

1530
03:19:31.150 --> 03:19:34.469
Mayank: So, the second I go on subscription, we have increased those limits. Okay, everyone?

1531
03:19:34.690 --> 03:19:36.589
Mayank: All the limits we have increased here.

1532
03:19:39.650 --> 03:19:45.159
Mayank: So, great. You can connect with me on LinkedIn and YouTube, everyone. It'll be very helpful.

1533
03:19:45.730 --> 03:19:51.789
Mayank: And I will accept your request once I close the session. So I think this page is slow, we have to do something for this, not a problem.

1534
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:54.340
Mayank: So, did it load?

1535
03:19:55.220 --> 03:19:59.990
Mayank: I think we have made some changes also on the backend, right? So that is also why it is taking a little bit of time.

1536
03:20:01.480 --> 03:20:06.289
Mayank: So, yeah, great event. I think the same chat will be helpful. Anyone has any suggestions, anything?

1537
03:20:12.220 --> 03:20:13.110
Mayank: Right?

1538
03:20:13.290 --> 03:20:20.189
Mayank: I hope all of you love this platform, so please make sure that you use this thing to the best extent. As I said, we are giving it for totally free.

1539
03:20:20.930 --> 03:20:23.189
Mayank: And I hope that should be helpful, okay?

1540
03:20:23.850 --> 03:20:26.669
Mayank: We have increased the limit from the backend, so that…

1541
03:20:26.670 --> 03:20:28.300
Monal Kumar: We also we get, right, mate?

1542
03:20:28.800 --> 03:20:29.590
Monal Kumar: And free.

1543
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:41.109
Mayank: Okay, so we have increased the limits at the free one every one, if I quickly show you. So, these are the updated limits. I think they are more than enough, not a problem, right? So, lots of regime is everything you are getting.

1544
03:20:41.270 --> 03:20:43.389
Mayank: Don't purchase or anything as of now.

1545
03:20:43.480 --> 03:20:47.719
Mayank: And yes, you will be able to use it just by creating a version.

1546
03:20:47.780 --> 03:21:07.309
Mayank: So, yes, we have put in lots of effort on this platform every year, and as you can see, very good UI, very modern key things, something which each and every one of you basically try to access. So, just one last thing to clarify. Just log in and you will be able to access everything.

1547
03:21:08.260 --> 03:21:09.870
Mayank: Okay, we limit it.

1548
03:21:10.250 --> 03:21:14.290
Mayank: So, that was all from… I hope you love the platform. So, can I get…

1549
03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:19.710
Mayank: Thank you.

1550
03:21:24.080 --> 03:21:27.979
Mayank: Great. So, cool everyone, now with that, let's meet…

1551
03:21:28.310 --> 03:21:36.209
Mayank: in the class or somewhere, I will now, I guess, give it back to Mona, sir. So please connect with me on my YouTube and LinkedIn, and please try to access the platform.

1552
03:21:36.240 --> 03:21:51.629
Mayank: As we said, it is a very, very awesome platform for the audience who want to actually make a shift, or let's say, improve their career, because we have included each and everything. Your interviews, your resumes, your roadmaps, all of these things we have been… we are basically making sure that we give you access to each and every of that, okay?

1553
03:21:51.630 --> 03:22:03.919
Mayank: So, with that, thanks a lot, everyone. I think… thanks a lot, Mona, for your time as well, and I think we can just continue with your doubts. Please make sure that you try out the platform, everyone, because as we said, normally we are giving it for free for all the students of this batch only.

1554
03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:06.840
Mayank: And the same, I believe, will be very helpful, okay?

1555
03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:09.440
Mayank: Cool then. Thank you. Bye-bye.

1556
03:22:10.500 --> 03:22:11.360
Monal Kumar: Thank you very much for me.

1557
03:22:11.980 --> 03:22:18.300
Monal Kumar: Guys, we have seen an awesome demo from my answer, and let me tell you one thing.

1558
03:22:18.520 --> 03:22:34.499
Monal Kumar: Meng is the whole architect of this particular project. He's architecting everything, so soon you will be seeing him, and you're… I hope everyone has subscribed to Meng's channel, because you will see awesome things in the YouTube channel as well. Alright?

1559
03:22:35.050 --> 03:22:39.790
Monal Kumar: Yes, is everyone clear? Everyone is feeling good. Good induction day.

1560
03:22:40.600 --> 03:22:42.099
Monal Kumar: Got a lot of things.

03:22:46.780 --> 03:23:02.170
Monal Kumar: I can see, raised hands are already lower than before, and guys, whoever query is already kind of a duplicate query of someone else, or similar kind of a query is already answered, please unraise your hand so that I can see the correct stats.

1563
03:23:02.930 --> 03:23:03.850
Monal Kumar: Alright?

1564
03:23:04.030 --> 03:23:09.879
Monal Kumar: Guys… See, unraise your hand if you think that your query has already been

1565
03:23:10.080 --> 03:23:13.620
Monal Kumar: Answered, not just your query, but a similar one is already answered.

1566
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:26.009
Monal Kumar: Guys, I do have a YouTube channel, and soon… in this month, you will see some videos, but still, it is not… I have not uploaded a single video, but this month, I will be uploading it. Then I will share my link, alright?

1567
03:23:26.010 --> 03:23:35.210
Monal Kumar: Okay, one more thing I wanted to start, that is, this is the first day, and I want all of you to at least be active here.

1568
03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:46.629

Monal Kumar: Okay? So let me write, guys, this is what you're going to see from the next… my writing, okay? My writing is not too great, but still, you guys have to deal with it.

1570
03:23:56.400 --> 03:24:02.580
Monal Kumar: Alright, so this is 2026 Day… One induction.

1571
03:24:04.120 --> 03:24:07.880
Monal Kumar: Don't worry, it is not that bad with… I'm writing

1572
03:24:08.270 --> 03:24:10.719
Monal Kumar: For the first time in a few weeks.

1573
03:24:11.730 --> 03:24:18.019
Monal Kumar: Alright? So what we are going to do, the first thing which I want to tell you before the doubt session part is the LinkedIn post.

1574
03:24:20.290 --> 03:24:21.170
Monal Kumar: Okay?

1575
03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:23.420
Monal Kumar: Estimate…

1576
03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:30.939
Monal Kumar: the LinkedIn post, how to post it, what should be the format, because I have seen a lot of people, they just write up

1577
03:24:31.470 --> 03:24:43.870
Monal Kumar: Let me select this blog. They just write their post like a paragraph, that someone is reading a blog. No. In LinkedIn, no one is there to read blogs. Guys, do you think that if you see

1578
03:24:44.280 --> 03:24:49.359
Monal Kumar: 5,000 words of a… in a post. Are you guys going to read that post?

1579
03:24:49.980 --> 03:24:52.319
Monal Kumar: Are you guys going to read that post?

1580
03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:58.260
Monal Kumar: Tell me, if you see 5,000 words in a post, will you read that? No.

1581
03:24:58.760 --> 03:25:15.110
Monal Kumar: you will not read it. The ideal way to create a small post, even if you think that I am not technically sound, or I have not done… I have not learned a lot much in this particular session, or in this whole week, because whatever, you are creating an assignment, you are creating a project, or you're learning something new from

1582
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:22.679
Monal Kumar: from different places, you just want other people to let, other people's… to tell that, okay, this is what I've been learning.

1583
03:25:22.680 --> 03:25:37.639
Monal Kumar: And maybe if you guys are interested, do interact with the post, or some comment or something, right? So what you will do, this is kind of the basic template which everyone should follow. Tell something about what this post is, little bit of intro.

1584
03:25:38.020 --> 03:25:44.770
Monal Kumar: Little bit of intro. But intro type to cover, and 30 to 40 words maximum.

1585
03:25:45.200 --> 03:25:46.640
Monal Kumar: Is this part clear?

1586
03:25:47.100 --> 03:25:48.490
Monal Kumar: Is this part clear?

1587
03:25:48.940 --> 03:26:12.399
Monal Kumar: Yeah, that hook of the video, hook of the post, right? So once you have that interesting thing, maybe you're saying that in this particular lecture, or in this particular session in Krishnak Academy, today we have seen these awesome things, we have learned all of those things. That part is… should be your intro. Then you will tell some interesting facts about that particular thing.

1588
03:26:12.400 --> 03:26:29.690
Monal Kumar: That is, this intro is, let's suppose this is about induction class. So, induction class intro is done within 30 to 40 words. This is the maximum. You can obviously go below that. After that, what you will do, you will create some kind of information. But again, do you want all the 5,000 words here?

1589
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:44.069
Monal Kumar: Do you want all the 5,000 words to be present here in the information? No. We don't want that. So what we want, we want some kind of a bullet point, we want some kind of a bullet point, or you can add those smileys, those emojic ones.

1590
03:26:44.180 --> 03:26:54.500
Monal Kumar: Right? Sometimes you will see that people write… people do start their bullet points with this one. Sometimes they start with smiley, yes?

1591
03:26:54.680 --> 03:27:02.150
Monal Kumar: How many of you have seen that post? Some of them starts with that Earth, that is a networking smiley con… emojicon.

1592
03:27:02.290 --> 03:27:03.999
Monal Kumar: How many of you have seen that?

1593
03:27:05.180 --> 03:27:19.490
Monal Kumar: So, intro about the post, what you are telling people, then what exactly you have done, but in an interesting manner. You don't want 500 words, you don't want 100, in very short. Then, later, if you want

1594
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:34.490
Monal Kumar: do like, comment, whatever you guys want. If you want, you can just add things at the footer of your post. Otherwise, this part is good. The smaller your post is going to be, the better it is for other people to read it fast, and then move to the next post.

1595
03:27:34.840 --> 03:27:43.860
Monal Kumar: So, you don't want other people to waste time in your post. It should be short, what you've done, and it should also have some hashtags. That is.

1596
03:27:44.020 --> 03:27:45.300
Monal Kumar: Machine learning.

1597
03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:51.490
Monal Kumar: Machine learning, okay? You will also write AI. You can write data science.

1598
03:27:51.600 --> 03:28:08.119
Monal Kumar: And also, you can tag me, Monol, you can also tag Krisher, you can tag Krishnak Academy, you can just search on it, okay? Krishnak Academy, and then we all will be able to see the post, we can interact with it so that other people can also see.

1599
03:28:08.120 --> 03:28:17.789
Monal Kumar: So this is how you should start. At least start posting something you will learn as you go, okay? The more you post, the more you will learn what people like, what people don't like. What will happen?

1600
03:28:17.790 --> 03:28:30.089
Monal Kumar: Once you have all of these tags and some details in the introduction or in the bullet points, suppose after 3 months, suppose after 3 months, someone is trying to search for machine learning.

1601
03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:35.380
Monal Kumar: And if your post says, lot of machine learning, whose name is going to pop up?

1602
03:28:35.900 --> 03:28:44.940
Monal Kumar: In LinkedIn, if you check, there are multiple sections. One of them, you will see people, another you will see jobs, then you will see location, and other things.

1603
03:28:45.060 --> 03:28:49.120
Monal Kumar: If someone searched for machine learning and people, who's

1604
03:28:49.590 --> 03:28:51.260
Monal Kumar: Post is going to pop up.

1605
03:28:52.150 --> 03:29:01.879
Monal Kumar: our post is going to pop up. Our post means people who are active in the LinkedIn community, your post is going to pop up, and this is what we also want.

1606
03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:06.699
Monal Kumar: So, is everyone having a clear understanding, John, and high-level overview.

1607
03:29:06.880 --> 03:29:11.210
Monal Kumar: what we have to do on LinkedIn, Guess?

1608
03:29:11.540 --> 03:29:12.690
Monal Kumar: Hi, everyone.

1609
03:29:14.220 --> 03:29:19.440
Monal Kumar: Do we have an idea now? What we have to do just from the template point of view? Great.

1610
03:29:19.660 --> 03:29:25.969
Monal Kumar: Alright? So, this is what I will suggest everyone to do. Let me show you something.

1611
03:29:26.220 --> 03:29:28.970
Monal Kumar: Okay, maybe I have it, maybe I don't.

1612
03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:51.989
Monal Kumar: Guys, for the quick summary, have an introduction, or something in short, which tells what this particular post is about. Then tell in bullet points, 3 points, 10 points. Don't make it too big. In short, but it should attract people, okay? In short, then write what footer is, maybe try to tag Krisher, me, my answer.

1613
03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:55.259
Monal Kumar: Krishna Academy, and then provide some hashtag. I will show you some

1614
03:29:55.260 --> 03:29:59.159
Monal Kumar: Guys, I'm providing my LinkedIn ID, and I will also show you some posts.

1615
03:29:59.640 --> 03:30:00.400
Monal Kumar: Okay?

1616
03:30:00.700 --> 03:30:05.239
Monal Kumar: Just wait. I'm providing my LinkedIn ID. You guys can follow me if you want.

1617
03:30:08.050 --> 03:30:11.400
Monal Kumar: Guys, this is my LinkedIn ID. I will accept everyone's request.

1618
03:30:15.360 --> 03:30:16.640
Monal Kumar: That's great.

Monal Kumar: See this?

1624
03:30:44.160 --> 03:30:48.629
Monal Kumar: Here, what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to provide some attention, then I'm trying to provide

1625
03:30:48.630 --> 03:31:05.920
Monal Kumar: what this particular post is about, then in bullet points, I provided something, then some kind of information, then I did some kind of a hashtag. Similar thing, you will be able to find a roadmap. Whoever is interested in the roadmap, you guys can see. In my LinkedIn post, you will be able to see AI roadmap for year 2526.

1626
03:31:05.920 --> 03:31:11.559
Monal Kumar: And here you can see all of those things, you will be able to see this roadmap also, which I have provided.

1627
03:31:11.580 --> 03:31:14.319
Monal Kumar: Yes, everyone is able to see the same thing.

1628
03:31:16.220 --> 03:31:24.779
Monal Kumar: Alright? And one more thing, that there will be a lot of questions regarding the hardware, yes? How many of you have questions regarding the hardware?

1629
03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:31.670
Monal Kumar: What laptop I should buy, what I should do, what I should not. Hardware. Yes, please mention in the chat.

1630
03:31:31.700 --> 03:31:34.259
Monal Kumar: So guys, please check out this post.

1631
03:31:34.260 --> 03:31:56.699
Monal Kumar: Here, I have talked about buying a machine from AIDL. Here's a quick recommendation. This is a recommendation which I have seen this will be applicable for 2526, so you guys will be able to see what is my recommendation. Maybe try to copy and paste to ChatGPT, and based on this one, try to check your requirement, alright? So I'm going to also share this post.

1632
03:31:57.000 --> 03:32:02.540
Monal Kumar: Copy link to the post, whoever is interested. Just a quick read, guys. Guys, is this 5,000 words?

1633
03:32:02.980 --> 03:32:05.610
Monal Kumar: Do you think this is a 5,000 words post?

1634
03:32:06.080 --> 03:32:09.460
Monal Kumar: Yes, how many of you are going to read it? Because it is short.

1635
03:32:09.790 --> 03:32:14.150
Monal Kumar: Only because it is short, how many of you are going to read this?

1636
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:15.780
Monal Kumar: Tell me!

1637
03:32:18.730 --> 03:32:25.610
Monal Kumar: Yes? So always make sure that your posts are good. See this? Emojic cons. These are good emojis, right?

1638
03:32:26.210 --> 03:32:45.519
Monal Kumar: It tells us, yes, it is short and nice. I'm not saying this is the best post you will see on LinkedIn, but I'm just giving you a template to how to post things so that other people will see. See, I have 8,555 impressions. The more people will see, the more people will know you, know your work. This is what you guys have to do as well.

1639
03:32:45.530 --> 03:32:51.190
Monal Kumar: Alright? So that's all about the LinkedIn post. Now, we will jump to the discussion part.

1640
03:32:52.350 --> 03:32:53.190
Monal Kumar: Okay.

1641
03:32:54.510 --> 03:33:00.439
Monal Kumar: So how many of you are going to post things from here on? How many of you are going to post things?

1642
03:33:01.890 --> 03:33:05.140
Monal Kumar: So many, not just ChatGPT, we use multiples.

1643
03:33:05.240 --> 03:33:07.790
Monal Kumar: That's great, guys, okay? Great.

1644
03:33:08.090 --> 03:33:12.970
Monal Kumar: Thank you very much. Okay, so now let's go to… the discussion.

1645
03:33:13.520 --> 03:33:18.510
Monal Kumar: Komal, you are… Next, Komal.

1646
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:43.409
Komal: Hi, Monol. I just wanted to give you a little background of myself, like, I have been working in the software industry, but as a business analyst, more on the requirement side, like the client side, and to get the things done from the developers and from the clients as well. So, I'm looking forward to dive into the machine learning role, and it will be more focused for the agent AKI part, or the generative AI part. So, just wanted to ask, by learning this course.

1647
03:33:43.410 --> 03:33:50.839
Komal: what should I work other than in these aspects, like generative AI and agent tech, so I can grasp more, learn.

1648
03:33:50.840 --> 03:34:07.079
Komal: more ahead, and so that I can gain, because I have been working in the industry for about 5 years, so I have to, like, jump into the more experienced role to get into that salary, or get into that experience. Understood. That's one thing, that's one question I would like to ask.

1649
03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:10.110
Monal Kumar: So you are more into, like, a consultant, right? Can we say more.

1650
03:34:10.110 --> 03:34:10.590
Komal: Yeah.

1651
03:34:10.590 --> 03:34:12.499
Monal Kumar: You are an AI consultant, right?

1652
03:34:12.980 --> 03:34:17.920
Monal Kumar: Alright, so for any consultant, they should not know the…

1653
03:34:18.230 --> 03:34:31.110
Monal Kumar: details of the coding, but they should know what this tool is, what we should use, and what we'll be able to get it from, right? What you can get from this particular tool. So, I would suggest more that for any technology, suppose we are talking about machine learning.

1654
03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:38.359
Monal Kumar: directly go to machine learning and learn. Watch few videos, you don't have to complete things end-to-end. What machine learning does, watch machine learning does not.

1655
03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:43.970
Monal Kumar: Similarly, go to the generative AI part. Krish, if you check in Krisher's YouTube channel.

1656
03:34:43.970 --> 03:34:59.139
Monal Kumar: Here, you will see a lot of these videos, a lot of these fun, videos, single short videos, right? In a single video, he's talking about what this new tool is, what this particular tool is, what this particular new domain is. So I will first suggest you to do homework on the high level.

1657
03:34:59.140 --> 03:35:01.500
Monal Kumar: What is Native BI? What are the new things there?

1658
03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:05.379
Monal Kumar: What if agent decay? What are the new things here? What is RAG? What are the new things there?

1659
03:35:05.380 --> 03:35:28.420
Monal Kumar: Once you think that you have covered that high-level knowledge, and at least you should know when to pick RAG, when to not pick, when to go to Generative AI, once you have that, then go into the types of RAG, what we should do, what it works with, what it does not work with. So, as a consultant, I would suggest you to understand do's and don'ts of each and every level, but at every level, try… the first level should be high level, then the next one should be the

1660
03:35:28.420 --> 03:35:33.330
Monal Kumar: Little bit more modular in terms of… more details in terms of,

1661
03:35:33.340 --> 03:35:38.289
Monal Kumar: What it does, what it does not, then go to all the… but not the coding part.

1662
03:35:38.290 --> 03:35:43.839
Komal: Sorry to interrupt, I'm not in the consultant role for AI, I am working as a business analyst, and.

1663
03:35:43.840 --> 03:35:44.969
Monal Kumar: Business analyst.

1664
03:35:44.970 --> 03:35:51.269
Komal: business analyst, where developers and clients, where there's a medium between a person who just get the requirements going, that the users.

1665
03:35:51.270 --> 03:35:51.650
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1666
03:35:51.650 --> 03:35:53.560
Komal: all the things done, so that's what…

1667
03:35:53.740 --> 03:36:10.849
Komal: So, that's one… that's the role I have. But I have to transition into the AI role. But I'm focused on generative AI and agent-tech AI roadmap. So, what should I hop first? Like, of course, I understand that I should learn the videos, basics of it, and everything into it, but developing certain things, how should I opt for that?

1668
03:36:11.100 --> 03:36:13.760
Monal Kumar: You want to develop some things as well, right?

1669
03:36:14.260 --> 03:36:15.190
Komal: Alright.

1670
03:36:15.190 --> 03:36:22.660
Monal Kumar: So, for developing something, what I would suggest is to have a very strong fundamentals in the Python part. Do you have Python? Do you know Python?

1671
03:36:22.930 --> 03:36:40.869
Monal Kumar: Yeah, I know Python, but basic one. Alright, so Python, without having a good understanding of the Python, even if you start the generative AI journey, all you will be able to do is just to learn something. But in terms of implementation, you require a good understanding of development that you will get from Python.

1672
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:54.850
Monal Kumar: So go with Python, go with API. Once you have both Python API integration, then I will suggest you directly jump onto the Generative AI part of it, so that you will know, what… with the skills of Generative AI, how to build around it.

1673
03:36:54.890 --> 03:36:55.730
Monal Kumar: Yes?

1674
03:36:55.910 --> 03:37:09.989
Monal Kumar: So, yes. But the machine learning part, don't leave this concept, because as you mentioned, that you will remove… you want to move it to the AI part of it. So, AI part, machine learning can come, deep learning can come, SQL can come, stats will come. That will make you a more seasoned data scientist.

1675
03:37:10.540 --> 03:37:11.590
Komal: Okay, okay.

1676
03:37:11.590 --> 03:37:19.999
Monal Kumar: But slowly move, like, just like Krishna mentioned, from the modern path, go all the way to the traditional path. But start from the modern, and go back to the traditional path.

1677
03:37:20.860 --> 03:37:21.710
Monal Kumar: Cool. Okay.

1678
03:37:23.180 --> 03:37:24.620
Monal Kumar: Good. Alright.

1679
03:37:24.810 --> 03:37:26.190
Monal Kumar: Anything else, Colin?

1680
03:37:27.740 --> 03:37:28.900
Komal: No thank you.

1681
03:37:29.230 --> 03:37:30.070
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure.

1682
03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:37.619
Monal Kumar: Alright, Muhammad, I did mention that Mac will work, but Mac totally depends on your

1683
03:37:38.060 --> 03:37:40.170
Monal Kumar: How should I say?

1684
03:37:41.080 --> 03:37:42.920
Monal Kumar: What is your budget around that?

1685
03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:44.970
Monal Kumar: Okay.

1686
03:37:45.340 --> 03:37:55.459
Monal Kumar: Mac, AI needs, it does AI needs, but I did mention about Mac. Mac, you should not do for training. Machine learning is fine. Don't go for deep learning. Dhananchai?

1687
03:37:58.190 --> 03:37:59.260
Monal Kumar: Rananjay?

1688
03:38:01.450 --> 03:38:02.460
Dhananjay: He has to…

1689
03:38:03.180 --> 03:38:04.509
Monal Kumar: Your query is already over?

1690
03:38:05.070 --> 03:38:09.019
Dhananjay: Yes, I have, like, texted you in, like, Zoom meeting.

1691
03:38:09.500 --> 03:38:13.589
Monal Kumar: But I cannot see, I have, as I mentioned, right, the message just keeps scrolling up.

1692
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:15.690
Dhananjay: Give me one second, sir.

1693
03:38:26.980 --> 03:38:32.780
Monal Kumar: whether for the tech stacks on that product, you know, to ask the architect. Architect is my…

1694
03:38:33.070 --> 03:38:34.489
Monal Kumar: Dharanja, what is that?

1695
03:38:34.970 --> 03:38:44.870
Dhananjay: So, sorry, sir. I was asking about, like, as I'm, like, pre-fi… as I'm in pre-finally a year of engineering so far, resume building and all,

1696
03:38:44.940 --> 03:38:55.539
Dhananjay: like, as Chris said, like, we, like, they will not provide certificate, like, they will only provide certificate of completion, then will it be fine for that?

1697
03:38:56.200 --> 03:39:00.230
Monal Kumar: We are not providing certificate of competition also. Krishna mentioned it.

1698
03:39:00.970 --> 03:39:02.630
Dhananjay: Okay, like.

1699
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:09.650
Monal Kumar: But why do you want certification? I don't even include certification. In some companies, they don't even ask me whether I'm a bachelor's or a master's person.

1700
03:39:10.130 --> 03:39:12.820
Dhananjay: Dhanisha, have you built something?

1701
03:39:13.890 --> 03:39:14.590
Dhananjay: No, sir.

1702
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:15.729
Monal Kumar: yet, that we.

1703
03:39:15.730 --> 03:39:16.660
Dhananjay: Got it.

1704
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.630
Monal Kumar: Are you clear?

1705
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:18.440
Dhananjay: Okay.

1706
03:39:18.440 --> 03:39:18.690
Monal Kumar: Heh.

1707
03:39:18.940 --> 03:39:19.340
Dhananjay: Yes, yes.

1708
03:39:19.340 --> 03:39:21.210
Monal Kumar: So your projects are your certificate.

1709
03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:26.720
Dhananjay: Okay, sir, I was actually concerned about that, so I would, like, like… I'm concerned.

1710
03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:34.969
Monal Kumar: Who is hiring by looking at your certificate, they are hiring you for a very fresher position, not for… not even for AI. They just want a person who knows IT.

1711
03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:43.750
Monal Kumar: And if you want to go into that job while you're doing this AI, then you need to rethink. Do you want to go into the normal IT or AI?

1712
03:39:44.330 --> 03:39:45.929
Dhananjay: No, so of course, yeah.

1713
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:47.420
Monal Kumar: You got my point, right?

1714
03:39:47.900 --> 03:39:48.840
Dhananjay: He hasn't.

1715
03:39:48.840 --> 03:39:49.890
Monal Kumar: Okay, sure.

1716
03:39:50.660 --> 03:39:51.420
Dhananjay: So…

1717
03:39:51.420 --> 03:39:52.230
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure.

1718
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:58.640
Monal Kumar: No problem, and Next is nitrogen.

1719
03:39:59.690 --> 03:40:05.139
Monal Kumar: After nitrogen, we have Murugan, but Murugan, after nitrogen, okay? Yeah. Natrajan.

1720
03:40:05.350 --> 03:40:10.559
Natrajan Subramanyam: Hi, Mona. Hello. So, first of all, wish you a Happy New Year, and .

1721
03:40:10.560 --> 03:40:10.980
Monal Kumar: been…

1722
03:40:10.980 --> 03:40:27.420
Natrajan Subramanyam: Thanks for bringing up this course for all of us. I just had one question. Yeah, regarding the hardware dependency, you… we will take it from your post, but I was more concerned towards the software, because I have a high-end hardware, but still on a Windows 7, so…

1723
03:40:27.900 --> 03:40:30.270
Monal Kumar: Windows is fine. Anything is fine.

1724
03:40:30.960 --> 03:40:32.570
Natrajan Subramanyam: Okay, Windows 7 is fine, okay.

1725
03:40:32.570 --> 03:40:33.000
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1726
03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:33.500
Natrajan Subramanyam: Yes.

1727
03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:46.850
Monal Kumar: Windows 7, you have Windows 7. That might create issue for the lower packages. You have to solve a lot of things, because, Devanshi, guys, okay, Natran, just give me a second, I think Devanshi is…

1728
03:40:46.970 --> 03:40:56.100
Monal Kumar: Spamming here. Devarshi, you will not be able to copy the text. Only link is clickable. Copy is not allowed in the Zoom default, okay?

1729
03:40:56.250 --> 03:41:00.109
Monal Kumar: Devanshi, just click a snapshot, and maybe keep it for now.

1730
03:41:00.250 --> 03:41:01.879
Monal Kumar: Yes, Naprajan, sorry for that.

1731
03:41:02.370 --> 03:41:02.700
Natrajan Subramanyam: Yeah, I know.

1732
03:41:03.240 --> 03:41:06.770
Monal Kumar: Yeah, so Windows 7 will be an issue, because

1733
03:41:07.290 --> 03:41:26.289
Monal Kumar: you can run things, but you personally have to debug a lot of things. If you don't want that debug, if you don't want… because the software packages which we have are latest, you need to check what works in your Windows, then when we work with Python and a lot of deep learning things, then you need to check which version works in your Windows 7. Are you getting my point?

1734
03:41:26.550 --> 03:41:27.840
Natrajan Subramanyam: Yeah, understood.

1735
03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:35.420
Monal Kumar: Okay, so if you don't want to deal with that, maybe you can install Linux in your system, because Linux is pretty standard with any of the hardware.

1736
03:41:35.620 --> 03:41:47.060
Monal Kumar: Okay? But if your system cannot run Windows 11, alright, only then do the Linux, otherwise there is a learning curve in Linux as well. So what is the situation? What exactly you want to do?

1737
03:41:49.050 --> 03:41:54.089
Natrajan Subramanyam: Yeah, in that case, I have to upgrade my OS. That is one option on Windows.

1738
03:41:54.090 --> 03:41:55.640
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes.

1739
03:41:55.980 --> 03:42:06.379
Monal Kumar: Because it is going to create an unnecessary issue for your learning, and that is something which I don't want, right? It is not an issue, but you have to be debugging a lot of things. It might be breaking a lot of things, alright?

1740
03:42:06.380 --> 03:42:08.170
Natrajan Subramanyam: Correct. Okay.

1741
03:42:08.610 --> 03:42:16.770
Monal Kumar: And yeah, someone suggested that you can dual boot also. You can also dual boot Windows and Windows 11 also, Windows 7 and dual boot Windows 11. You can also.

1742
03:42:16.770 --> 03:42:17.570
Natrajan Subramanyam: do that.

1743
03:42:17.810 --> 03:42:25.900
Monal Kumar: But based on the system, maybe it is consumed… just check it, check your system configuration, whether it is… it is not an old system, or it is very old.

1744
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:30.770
Natrajan Subramanyam: It's a Lenovo ThinkPad with i7 processor.

1745
03:42:30.770 --> 03:42:33.529
Monal Kumar: I, someone will handle… I, someone can handle anything, yeah.

1746
03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:35.879
Monal Kumar: Okay, sure. That's great.

1747
03:42:36.210 --> 03:42:37.639
Monal Kumar: Dual boot it if you want.

1748
03:42:37.960 --> 03:42:40.439
Natrajan Subramanyam: Okay, thanks for a good option, yeah.

1749
03:42:40.440 --> 03:42:41.759
Monal Kumar: Yeah, share it to them, yeah.

1750
03:42:42.020 --> 03:42:48.330
Monal Kumar: Yes, thank you very much, LazyKamer. He told that small dual boat.

1751
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:56.729
Monal Kumar: Guys, everyone will get a chance to speak. Mike is not previously. Okay, Surya, guys. Okay, after that, it is Murugan.

1752
03:42:56.970 --> 03:42:58.170
Monal Kumar: Morgan, MK?

1753
03:42:58.950 --> 03:43:01.619
Murugan MK: Hello, sir, good afternoon, this is Dharmesh.

1754
03:43:01.850 --> 03:43:05.000
Murugan MK: Okay. This is my uncle's lab, so it's, named as me.

1755
03:43:05.160 --> 03:43:09.310
Monal Kumar: Yeah, myself, Dharmesh, and I'm posing a BTEC AZ first year.

1756
03:43:10.240 --> 03:43:14.569
Murugan MK: Yeah, my interest is, like, entering into tech industry.

1757
03:43:15.190 --> 03:43:20.239
Murugan MK: At the end of this course, I'll be in my mid-second year. Is this enough?

1758
03:43:20.440 --> 03:43:21.190
Murugan MK: Is this enough?

1759
03:43:21.190 --> 03:43:22.360
Monal Kumar: will be more than C.

1760
03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:23.060
Murugan MK: Meeting?

1761
03:43:23.380 --> 03:43:33.840
Monal Kumar: Okay, I will tell you. Everyone here who stayed till now, guys, everyone, Murugan, I'm not targeting you, okay? I know your name is not Murugan, but I can see this name, okay? Yeah.

1762
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:39.740
Monal Kumar: So, guys, this is, not targeting to anyone, but see this.

1763
03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:45.810
Monal Kumar: Do you want to hire a chef who does not know how to cook? Guys, answer in the chat.

1764
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:49.149
Monal Kumar: Do you want to hire a chef who does not know how to cook?

1765
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:51.260
Monal Kumar: No.

1766
03:43:53.150 --> 03:43:54.510
Monal Kumar: So…

1767
03:43:54.920 --> 03:44:04.259
Monal Kumar: If that chef asks that, even though that chef does not know cooking, based on the industry standard, that chef can cook noodles for his own.

1768
03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:13.360
Monal Kumar: Alright? That chef can cook noodle for his own, but cannot make food that others requires. Do you think that Chef is going to survive in the industry?

1769
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:20.159
Monal Kumar: That chef can survive for his own, but cannot survive for the industry. Not from noodles.

1770
03:44:20.270 --> 03:44:23.280
Monal Kumar: Similarly, it is the case for everyone.

1771
03:44:23.620 --> 03:44:28.940
Monal Kumar: If you think that this course is over, this course is the pinnacle of giving us a job.

1772
03:44:29.850 --> 03:44:38.120
Monal Kumar: Does, industry seize cores or skills as the requirement? Is scores the requirement, or is skills the requirement?

1773
03:44:38.270 --> 03:44:39.510
Monal Kumar: I'm asking everyone.

1774
03:44:40.100 --> 03:44:43.849
Monal Kumar: Guys, skills are the requirement. And what are skills?

1775
03:44:44.030 --> 03:44:51.520
Monal Kumar: Are they, are they just going to ask you Python interview in the job, or they want you to build something in the job?

1776
03:44:51.690 --> 03:44:52.999
Monal Kumar: What is the requirement?

1777
03:44:53.380 --> 03:44:57.519
Monal Kumar: Requirement is to answer the interview question, or requirement is to just build something.

1778
03:44:57.880 --> 03:45:06.380
Monal Kumar: Guys, requirement is to build something. So, if anyone is here is able to build something, Then…

1779
03:45:06.490 --> 03:45:09.030
Monal Kumar: It is… you… your job is done.

1780
03:45:09.090 --> 03:45:17.579
Monal Kumar: you are good for the interview. But if your skill set is only the concepts and know how to code.

1781
03:45:17.580 --> 03:45:29.229
Monal Kumar: then it is not going to make you industry ready. So this course is a way to achieve those skills and to be confident while creating the project. But is this course is going to give you a job?

1782
03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:32.220
Monal Kumar: Is this course going to give you a job?

1783
03:45:32.600 --> 03:45:34.340
Monal Kumar: What is going to give you a job?

1784
03:45:34.980 --> 03:45:37.279
Monal Kumar: Tell me what is going to give you a job.

1785
03:45:39.910 --> 03:45:43.779
Monal Kumar: Your personal skills and project building skills.

1786
03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:52.510
Monal Kumar: Until and unless you have that final skill which industry wants, you are that chef who only knows to cook for himself.

1787
03:45:54.380 --> 03:45:58.059
Monal Kumar: This is for everyone, and yes, Murugan is this part here?

1788
03:45:59.190 --> 03:46:00.160
Murugan MK: Eso.

1789
03:46:00.160 --> 03:46:13.409
Monal Kumar: So by the end of this course, you will know how to do things, but if you don't do… if you don't build… do you think WhatsApp is some kind of a… if I talk about application of WhatsApp, do you think WhatsApp is a… WhatsApp is a student project?

1790
03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:32.260
Monal Kumar: WhatsApp is just a small project? No. WhatsApp is a product. It's an idea that is converted to a product. So once you complete this course, take a problem statement, not just completing the course in the middle also, take a problem statement and solve with coding. Once you are able to convert problem statement to a solution, it means you are an engineer and you can be hired.

1791
03:46:33.500 --> 03:46:34.729
Monal Kumar: Are you clear, Morgan?

1792
03:46:35.140 --> 03:46:36.020
Murugan MK: Yes, sir, thank you.

1793
03:46:36.020 --> 03:46:42.069
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes. This is for everyone, and guys, whoever question is around that, please unraise your hand, if you have the same thing.

1794
03:46:43.610 --> 03:46:44.370
Monal Kumar: Alright.

1795
03:46:44.770 --> 03:46:48.250
Monal Kumar: So, Surya, you are next.

1796
03:46:49.060 --> 03:46:51.030
SURYA: Hi Meng, can you hear me now?

1797
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:52.249
Monal Kumar: Yes, Surya, I can hear you.

1798
03:46:52.570 --> 03:46:57.339
SURYA: Thanks, I think there was some issue with my mic previously, so I couldn't talk.

1799
03:46:57.340 --> 03:46:57.860
Monal Kumar: Yeah, no problem.

1800
03:46:58.180 --> 03:47:03.859
SURYA: Pharma background, with 10 years' experience working in clinical trials, completely not related to the data part.

1801
03:47:04.220 --> 03:47:05.580
SURYA: The current thing.

1802
03:47:05.730 --> 03:47:09.790
SURYA: But I want to switch towards the data science within the life sciences and healthcare.

1803
03:47:09.790 --> 03:47:10.320
Monal Kumar: It is like…

1804
03:47:10.320 --> 03:47:14.209
SURYA: I'm an enthusiast for learning the data science here.

1805
03:47:14.530 --> 03:47:27.389
SURYA: So, I just want to know… so, the skills… I have a couple of questions here. So, whatever I'm learning here would be helpful, means, from the scratch, I can learn from the scratch, right? Because I'm not from even a mathematics background.

1806
03:47:27.390 --> 03:47:33.980
Monal Kumar: I will teach you from very… not from mathematics background, but do you know… do you know, trigonometry?

1807
03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:35.020
SURYA: Yes.

1808
03:47:35.480 --> 03:47:37.289
Monal Kumar: You know, mattresses?

1809
03:47:37.630 --> 03:47:39.930
SURYA: Yes, I am… yeah, I know that.

1810
03:47:39.930 --> 03:47:43.129
Monal Kumar: At least just aware of it. I'm not asking the formula, okay?

1811
03:47:43.470 --> 03:47:51.280
Monal Kumar: You do know what is dot product, you do know a little bit of things, right? It's totally fine, that's all you need to know. But if you say, I don't even know maths.

1812
03:47:51.640 --> 03:47:55.070
SURYA: Okay, then… I know maths, until…

1813
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:57.369
Monal Kumar: That is totally fine, I will teach you everything, man.

1814
03:47:57.370 --> 03:48:02.120
SURYA: And post that in my academics, we have a course for, all the…

1815
03:48:02.460 --> 03:48:05.230
SURYA: Yeah, again, the integration and all, I'm aware of that.

1816
03:48:05.230 --> 03:48:05.990
Monal Kumar: That's great.

1817
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:10.339
SURYA: Not required to be a mathematics background for getting any job, right?

1818
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:12.939
SURYA: No, no, no, no, you don't require that.

1819
03:48:13.210 --> 03:48:23.909
Monal Kumar: No, no, no, you don't require it, and I will… whenever there is a term called a differentiation, right, even come into one of the topics, I will teach you what exactly is differentiation better than your college.

1820
03:48:24.080 --> 03:48:26.840
Monal Kumar: And the school. Don't worry. Okay? Okay.

1821
03:48:27.040 --> 03:48:29.240
SURYA: Okay, then other question is…

1822
03:48:29.240 --> 03:48:29.800
Monal Kumar: Hmm.

1823
03:48:30.010 --> 03:48:39.810
SURYA: I have another question. So, other than moving to the life sciences, so I can also try switching to other domains also, right? In this case, if I'm able to build the requirements.

1824
03:48:39.810 --> 03:48:44.729
Monal Kumar: If you're able to build it, yes. If you're able to build the requirement, you can… you can jump there, alright?

1825
03:48:44.730 --> 03:48:56.290
SURYA: Okay, yeah, and here, as you mentioned, that you're not providing any domain-specific projects, so if I want to, know any… if I want to do any domain-specific things, I can do it on my own.

1826
03:48:56.290 --> 03:48:57.280
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1827
03:48:57.280 --> 03:48:58.040
SURYA: on that?

1828
03:48:58.040 --> 03:49:06.620
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes. Say, think of this AI as I'm keep saying it now, and I will keep saying it till the time I'm going to teach everyone here.

1829
03:49:07.140 --> 03:49:18.039
Monal Kumar: I want all of you to become engineers. And Surya, let me give you one product statement. If you want a clean water in your house, and clean water is not coming, what is the one thing which you need?

1830
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:20.549
Monal Kumar: I told you the problem. What is the solution?

1831
03:49:21.540 --> 03:49:24.260
SURYA: I have to install some filter or some system.

1832
03:49:24.260 --> 03:49:33.079
Monal Kumar: Great. So, that is purified, right? You just need to install some kind of a filter. If you want cool air in your home, it is summer, what you will do.

1833
03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:42.739
Monal Kumar: you will install IAC, right? Similarly, we have to become engineers. We will have problem. Problem can be from any domain.

1834
03:49:42.860 --> 03:49:49.590
Monal Kumar: this is the good thing about data, this good thing about the data science and AI is, the base of everything is data.

1835
03:49:49.810 --> 03:50:08.100
Monal Kumar: Data is nothing but numbers and everything which we're going to learn. But numbers can be from healthcare, numbers can be from telecom, numbers can be from civil engineers, right? The civil data and other things. But at the end, all of those are data. What those data are comes from the domain knowledge, like, the explanation of those data.

1836
03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:16.680
Monal Kumar: So, that explanation itself, if you're able to provide, you can understand and convert any of your understanding into the AI solution.

1837
03:50:17.230 --> 03:50:18.439
SURYA: Okay, sure.

1838
03:50:18.780 --> 03:50:19.390
Monal Kumar: Yes?

1839
03:50:19.520 --> 03:50:32.759
SURYA: One related question to this. Actually, recently I have seen some life sciences consultant and healthcare consultant jobs where they're asking mathematics background to be there. That is the reason why I had this question, like, am I really required to have that math… mathematics or technical.

1840
03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:41.809
Monal Kumar: Okay, that is their requirement, mathematics background. So, to learn AI, you don't require a mathematics background. AI is kind of a skill for you now. For in health science or something.

1841
03:50:41.820 --> 03:50:54.669
Monal Kumar: you have already a domain that is your skill, right? If that is one of the requirements. You will have 10 requirements. In that time requirement, mathematics is their requirement, mathematics is not a requirement to learn AI at this in this course.

1842
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:59.689
Monal Kumar: So, if they require mathematics, you need to learn from them, not for the CI. Are you clear?

1843
03:50:59.690 --> 03:51:04.079
SURYA: Okay. I'm just asking from the job's point of view, is it required? Because.

1844
03:51:04.080 --> 03:51:23.899
Monal Kumar: In John's point of view, indirectly, AI jobs, it is not required, but that job, again, is based on some kind of AI. Let's suppose you're doing remote analytics from the satellite. Maybe from satellite, they require some understanding of coordinates and other things, right? That might require some mathematics. So that is mathematics required for that domain, not for the AI.

1845
03:51:23.900 --> 03:51:27.220
SURYA: Okay. Few jobs might require, not all.

1846
03:51:27.220 --> 03:51:29.210
Monal Kumar: Yes, not all, not all, yes.

1847
03:51:29.210 --> 03:51:32.109
SURYA: But also, there is a mathematics course that Krishna Xar has.

1848
03:51:32.110 --> 03:51:46.300
Monal Kumar: Yes, you can take it, it is a very good course. Anyone who wants to understand mathematics in more detail, and wants to be little… and wants to be confident that at least I know maths, they can take that course in Udemystra has the Mathematics Foundation course.

1849
03:51:46.300 --> 03:51:47.790
SURYA: Okay, I'll do that, apparently.

1850
03:51:47.790 --> 03:51:50.020
Monal Kumar: Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, welcome.

1851
03:51:50.940 --> 03:51:56.789
Monal Kumar: Alright, then we have Vivek and Dhiraj. First, Vivek, then Deeraj.

1852
03:51:59.220 --> 03:52:02.730
Monal Kumar: No Chandan. Data structure and algorithm is not required. Yes?

1853
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:10.200
Vivek Palvia: Yeah, good morning, sir. This is Vivek Palvia, and I'll briefly talk about my experience. I have about 23 years of experience.

1854
03:52:10.200 --> 03:52:11.240
Monal Kumar: Nice!

1855
03:52:11.240 --> 03:52:16.559
Vivek Palvia: Yeah, in IT, I did start with manual testing, did some automation, then…

1856
03:52:16.560 --> 03:52:23.060
Monal Kumar: Moved into support and did implementation consulting work in the US, came back to India in 2019.

1857
03:52:23.390 --> 03:52:27.740
Vivek Palvia: So now I'm working as a platform manager in a company in Bangalore.

1858
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:35.000
Vivek Palvia: My question was, I have made various attempts to get into, you know, development side of work.

1859
03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:53.480
Vivek Palvia: And I have not been successful so far, primarily because people focus on a lot in data structure and algorithm part of the knowledge, right? So I was wondering if in this course, you are going to cover, you know, ML or Gen AI-specific, some of the.

1860
03:52:53.480 --> 03:52:54.040
Monal Kumar: No.

1861
03:52:54.040 --> 03:52:55.040
Vivek Palvia: structures.

1862
03:52:55.410 --> 03:53:10.309
Monal Kumar: No, see, for ML, Gen AI, they don't require data structures. Data structures and algorithm is required for the software development, okay? Personally speaking, I will tell you that, if you met 10 AI engineers.

1863
03:53:10.570 --> 03:53:23.879
Monal Kumar: only 2 or 3 out of them will be a good software developer. Other only know AI things. But in the market, it is the requirement that… now it is a requirement that someone who knows software development also will become a great AI engineer.

1864
03:53:24.030 --> 03:53:43.429
Monal Kumar: All right? Yes, Bilal, I will answer your query next, okay? So, for the software development, we require data structure and algorithm, and it is basically that data structure is required how to store, how to create an optimal data structure, so we can retrieve the data and work with the data faster and efficiently. That is data structure.

1865
03:53:43.570 --> 03:54:00.959
Monal Kumar: And algorithms is a part where if we write algorithms to retrieve the data, or to solve a particular problem from the algorithms, with the use of algorithms. Algorithms you will also see in the machine learning, deep learning, but algorithm, basic thing is, algorithms is a set of steps to solve a particular problem.

1866
03:54:01.290 --> 03:54:19.220
Monal Kumar: So, data structures efficiently store the data set, and algorithms, when combined with data structures, is the optimal way to store, retrieve, do all these kinds of things in an optimized manner. So, it is not related to data science or Python, it is related to a part of coding which is used to make bigger systems efficient.

1867
03:54:20.240 --> 03:54:24.680
Monal Kumar: Are we clear? So it is a tool. It is a tool and understanding of that. Yes.

1868
03:54:25.280 --> 03:54:44.069
Vivek Palvia: So, one more question I had as a follow-up was, at my experience level, like, we have also talked about it in the past in this session today, that, what is the right way to, you know, what is the right entry point? So, what do you suggest? I mean, I want to kind of get a summary again, yeah.

1869
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:54.059
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes. See, this is the kind of thing which everyone in this field is kind of doing right now, and you are, as an experienced person, I will suggest you to think that

1870
03:54:54.370 --> 03:55:01.980
Monal Kumar: what is your future goals in terms of job positions, okay? If you think that you want to become Gen AI engineer.

1871
03:55:02.140 --> 03:55:12.330
Monal Kumar: That's something which I will not suggest, just because you already have a 23 years of experience. Now, within your positions, tell me, within your positions, what are the different job roles available?

1872
03:55:12.600 --> 03:55:18.270
Monal Kumar: What do you think people with 23 years' experience are now? Job rules, in terms of job roles.

1873
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:24.009
Vivek Palvia: They… I mean, it could be different technologies, but they are director, senior director, etc, right?

1874
03:55:24.010 --> 03:55:38.399
Monal Kumar: Yes. So what you can also do is that senior director is something that is not everyone in the same years of experience is doing, right? Some of them are still managing the project, some of them are kind of a regional head, some of them are doing something like that, right?

1875
03:55:38.400 --> 03:55:46.389
Monal Kumar: And, are you facing any difficulty going to, those positions? What exactly…

1876
03:55:46.860 --> 03:55:51.200
Monal Kumar: Are they asking what exactly do you don't have? This is just one-to-one conversation, suppose.

1877
03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:51.800
Vivek Palvia: Yeah.

1878
03:55:51.800 --> 03:55:53.110
Monal Kumar: What exactly do you think? Yeah.

1879
03:55:53.110 --> 03:56:04.939
Vivek Palvia: What is happening is, our technology is declining in the company that I work for, right? I mean, it's not in the growth trajectory. I mean, if you go outside, also, there's, you know,

1880
03:56:06.300 --> 03:56:14.539
Vivek Palvia: Less experienced people are, you know, able to do the job, and they no longer need higher experienced people for that particular technology.

1881
03:56:14.540 --> 03:56:17.010
Monal Kumar: So that's… that's the thing, you know.

1882
03:56:17.320 --> 03:56:31.679
Monal Kumar: So, I think the issue right now is your technology has become kind of stagnant, right? It is not improving, and that is kind of restricting your job growth, because the technology is not improving. They don't require more of these, right?

1883
03:56:31.680 --> 03:56:32.450
Vivek Palvia: Exactly.

1884
03:56:32.450 --> 03:56:38.360
Monal Kumar: So, I will better suggest, to now go for…

1885
03:56:38.560 --> 03:56:44.420
Monal Kumar: What exactly is your day-to-day work, what you do now, right now? Let me understand that first.

1886
03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:59.360
Vivek Palvia: Yeah, I actually have a team of 8 people that I manage, so it's, I would say 40% of people management, 60% of technology, end-to-end work, and, you know, ends up work, yeah.

1887
03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:02.120
Monal Kumar: Alright, so this is more like a people management, or…

1888
03:57:02.330 --> 03:57:17.810
Monal Kumar: People soft part of it, right? Yeah. I think this is a good position, but for you to showcase the… you already have those skills. Have you applied to any of those companies? Any other companies in your same position?

1889
03:57:19.020 --> 03:57:21.739
Vivek Palvia: I mean, those positions are no longer there. If I look…

1890
03:57:21.740 --> 03:57:36.729
Monal Kumar: No, I'm not seeing the lead, because, see, if you… the position that you have, that you have people, management, and others, they directly don't ask the technologies. They just ask that you should under have… you should understand that how to lead people

1891
03:57:37.040 --> 03:57:42.199
Monal Kumar: So, are there no positions that requires leading people, and they only require some type kind of a skill?

1892
03:57:42.960 --> 03:57:46.360
Monal Kumar: What skills are you not able to have? This is what I want to understand.

1893
03:57:47.070 --> 03:57:58.829
Vivek Palvia: Basically, the key issue that I have is I have never done programming in my 23 years. I mean, I have never done any program that I have put into production. I have done some programs as hobbies.

1894
03:57:58.830 --> 03:57:59.590
Monal Kumar: Yay.

1895
03:57:59.590 --> 03:58:17.979
Vivek Palvia: So, that is the key thing that I miss. And nowadays, you know, be it any technology, they would definitely require some of the design skills, some of the programming skills, some of the architectural condition, you know, considerations. So, these are definitely coming up in the interviews. So…

1896
03:58:18.800 --> 03:58:22.639
Monal Kumar: What positions… I just want to understand what position you applied, where they are asking this.

1897
03:58:23.020 --> 03:58:33.529
Vivek Palvia: So, I applied for a senior manager position for platform engineering, and they started asking me, yeah, how will you architect a SaaS solution, for example?

1898
03:58:33.930 --> 03:58:34.970
Monal Kumar: Alright, alright, alright.

1899
03:58:34.970 --> 03:58:35.410
Vivek Palvia: Yeah.

1900
03:58:35.410 --> 03:58:51.870
Monal Kumar: the next thing which you will be going is kind of architect position itself, because you have from T3. All right, so let's create a plan for you, and for the architect, I will not suggest… I will suggest to learn this course, but in parallel, what you have to do is you need to understand the ops part of it.

1901
03:58:52.190 --> 03:58:52.550
Vivek Palvia: Okay.

1902
03:58:52.550 --> 03:59:03.830
Monal Kumar: Are you clear? So, I would suggest you to understand data engineering fundamentals. Not all. I will not say to go into the Hadoop and see what are the things that happens in Hadoop.

1903
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:21.849
Monal Kumar: what Hadoop does, what Spark does, why do we use it, what are the few technical things on there. Once you have it, then… because for any architect, they need to know the data in and the output also, what we are providing in this whole ecosystem. And right now, you require those technologies to be learned.

1904
03:59:22.090 --> 03:59:33.159
Monal Kumar: In the meantime, you're learning the AI part of it. Are you getting my point? From this course? So, in parallel to this course, I would suggest you to write it down. Write first data engineering part.

1905
03:59:33.340 --> 03:59:42.619
Monal Kumar: Alright? So, learn what are the technologies used in the data engineering, and what we should do. Then, we should talk about some message cues. We should understand message queues.

1906
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:45.069
Monal Kumar: So, also write it down, message queues.

1907
03:59:46.100 --> 03:59:46.810
Monal Kumar: Okay?

1908
03:59:47.040 --> 03:59:47.980
Vivek Palvia: Okay.

1909
03:59:47.980 --> 03:59:54.349
Monal Kumar: Message queues, and this is part of data engineering, message queues is also over.

1910
03:59:54.520 --> 04:00:00.630
Monal Kumar: And, I think for now… okay, learn…

1911
04:00:00.820 --> 04:00:06.299
Monal Kumar: little bit of cloud, that what actually, we should deploy. You know database? Yes.

1912
04:00:06.300 --> 04:00:07.659
Vivek Palvia: Yes, yeah, yes.

1913
04:00:07.660 --> 04:00:26.089
Monal Kumar: as you already know, right? That how to, think in terms of scale and maintainability. So, scale means horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, when we should do horizontal, vertical, this is the basic, but you should go in depth. That I have the system, tomorrow I need to think everything in terms of scale, that this is the system.

1914
04:00:26.090 --> 04:00:35.680
Monal Kumar: If tomorrow 10 million people is going to interact with the system, what I should do with this, so you will be learning Kubernetes and Dockers there, but on a high-level overview.

1915
04:00:35.690 --> 04:00:36.190
Monal Kumar: Okay.

1916
04:00:36.620 --> 04:00:37.370
Vivek Palvia: Okay.

1917
04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:45.459
Monal Kumar: Again, first, target everything as a high-level overview, so tomorrow, if I give you a problem statement, you don't provide me the solution, you provide me the architecture.

1918
04:00:46.470 --> 04:00:47.910
Monal Kumar: where I will attach what.

1919
04:00:48.350 --> 04:01:03.979
Monal Kumar: All right? And then the APIs and other things. So first, cover that this is your kind of a side quest which you should do, in parallel to this particular course. And I, like, stay connected with me on the LinkedIn. Once you do all of this, then we will plan something more. All right, Jay?

1920
04:01:03.980 --> 04:01:06.610
Vivek Palvia: Sure, sure, definitely. Thanks a lot.

1921
04:01:06.610 --> 04:01:07.890
Monal Kumar: Sure, sure, Rick, yes?

1922
04:01:09.380 --> 04:01:17.059
Monal Kumar: Okay, next, guys, just wait, bilal, are you still here?

1923
04:01:18.290 --> 04:01:21.130
Monal Kumar: Belar… Let me check.

1924
04:01:23.460 --> 04:01:24.300
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1925
04:01:25.050 --> 04:01:26.130
Monal Kumar: Hey, Bilal.

1926
04:01:27.740 --> 04:01:31.270
Bilal Molani: Hey, hi, I'm Manal Haripish. Yes, yes. Hope you're doing well.

1927
04:01:32.040 --> 04:01:38.990
Bilal Molani: I'll start with my background. My question is also similar to what everyone is asking. So, my background,

1928
04:01:39.210 --> 04:01:43.830
Bilal Molani: So, I've been in Canada working for the past 8 years now.

1929
04:01:44.400 --> 04:01:52.050
Bilal Molani: I… I'm working in one of the major banks here in the anti-money laundering and… Fraud detection team.

1930
04:01:52.310 --> 04:02:05.649
Bilal Molani: on… because banks are using some Actamize Paga, and those kinds of software, so I've been working more heavily on the SQL, and before that, I had the Java developer background, so I'm basically a software development team.

1931
04:02:05.650 --> 04:02:06.780
Monal Kumar: That's nice.

1932
04:02:06.800 --> 04:02:11.630
Bilal Molani: I wanted to know, because I want to transition into AI,

1933
04:02:12.230 --> 04:02:31.389
Bilal Molani: Yeah, I understand that you mentioned that there should be a problem which needs to be solved. I see that in the banks, which is… because these systems are not exposed to AI, because they are not open source, I wanted to know if, after learning this course, or maybe grinding hard…

1934
04:02:31.390 --> 04:02:35.109
Monal Kumar: You'll be able to apply it, in banking systems and others.

1935
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:54.629
Monal Kumar: they don't go all the way till generative AI, because generative AI, once you understand the main concept of it, you will understand that why all of these solutions require machine learning. So I think within a few months, you will be able to apply that part of machine learning, and you will understand where exactly we require what we should do, what we should not.

1936
04:02:55.310 --> 04:03:03.709
Bilal Molani: Sure, sure. One more question I think you might have answered more close to that. So, for example, once we complete this course, because

1937
04:03:03.930 --> 04:03:11.760
Bilal Molani: when we apply for a job, or when we see some position, they told us… we see that they need 3 to 4 or 5 years of experience.

1938
04:03:12.090 --> 04:03:15.170
Bilal Molani: But the thing is, how do we reflect,

1939
04:03:16.360 --> 04:03:31.229
Bilal Molani: on our resume, to be picked it up and to be considered. Is it… because if I was a fresh graduate, I can provide these projects, right? But the actual work in the organization, how will I be able to tweak in the resume and…

1940
04:03:31.230 --> 04:03:46.080
Monal Kumar: all you need to do, this is a smart work which you have to do, okay? Something that, in your previous organization, because HRs, I know this is going in a little bit wrong direction, but HRs will not know what project you have worked on, yes?

1941
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:47.130
Bilal Molani: Yes.

1942
04:03:47.130 --> 04:03:56.839
Monal Kumar: company cannot call the X company and say that, has this person worked on this X project? They cannot… they cannot never ask this, yes?

1943
04:03:57.380 --> 04:03:57.879
Bilal Molani: What do you.

1944
04:03:57.880 --> 04:04:12.719
Monal Kumar: are going to do, because you have an understanding of the previous project, and once you understand machine learning and generative AI, all these parts, you will have an idea that in the previous project I was working, in what place I can integrate AI so it makes sense.

1945
04:04:12.900 --> 04:04:17.430
Monal Kumar: You don't have to solve it, you just have to write it just to make yourself relevant.

1946
04:04:18.400 --> 04:04:25.619
Monal Kumar: Makes sense, makes sense. If you know… because if you know that project well, you know all the bits and bits of it, right?

1947
04:04:26.250 --> 04:04:27.239
Bilal Molani: Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1948
04:04:27.540 --> 04:04:32.179
Monal Kumar: If you know that, AI is just a part that you have integrated, and now you're relevant.

1949
04:04:32.180 --> 04:04:54.020
Monal Kumar: So, whenever someone is going to ask that in the interview, you're going to tell them in the terms of the flow and where the AI got and what it moved, because a lot of the things in AI, kind of a POC and MVP kind of a product, if you're able to integrate that and provide some kind of a solution, or provide some kind of a new functionality to the existing product, then you have integrated successfully. You can do that.

1950
04:04:54.780 --> 04:05:14.440
Bilal Molani: Yeah, yeah, definitely, I can think about it, sure, sure. Yes, sure. One last question. So, since I've been working here, I understand that the class on the Wednesday will be in the daytime, so I might be missing all the classes of Wednesday, and probably on Thursday after 24 hours, I will be having those lectures, right? Yes, yes, yes.

1951
04:05:15.040 --> 04:05:29.079
Bilal Molani: And also, I want to know regarding the Saturday and Sunday class, how long does the lecture is? Because I see right now it's 2.30, in the morning, so… and what time I can drop off, and I just wanted to know, out of 4 hours.

1952
04:05:29.080 --> 04:05:47.809
Monal Kumar: It is 3 hours, with 20 minutes of break in between, okay? You will have 1 20 minutes… 15 to 20 minutes of break within that 3 hours, and after 3 hours, we start the dog session. So, there is around 2 hours and 40 minutes of session, always in Saturday and Sunday. After that, you can drop off.

1953
04:05:48.840 --> 04:05:54.319
Bilal Molani: Okay, perfect, sounds good. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much, Ron. Have a wonderful day.

1954
04:05:55.340 --> 04:05:55.960
Monal Kumar: Good day.

1955
04:05:56.310 --> 04:06:01.070
Monal Kumar: And, yes, Pawan, you asked that nominal and Banking, they have started… guys.

1956
04:06:01.240 --> 04:06:26.189
Monal Kumar: Pawan, in banking, they have also started generative AI, and if you understand, generative AI, generative AI works on the data. It does not do the statistical prediction. It predicts the next token with some uncertainty or certainty, right? So it is used in the cases where we want to extract, summarize, and other things, but machine learning is used for places where we have certain kind of a confidence to predict

1957
04:06:26.190 --> 04:06:34.139
Monal Kumar: some kind of regression, number, fraud. You don't predict fraud with generative AI, you predict fraud with machine learning and all of these systems.

1958
04:06:34.240 --> 04:06:42.850
Monal Kumar: So, I was talking in terms of, what the previous system was built on for that person, not for the now cases.

1959
04:06:43.180 --> 04:06:44.520
Monal Kumar: Oh, one, are you clear?

1960
04:06:45.010 --> 04:06:52.100
Monal Kumar: Yeah, so it is… the use case is different, GenetiVear, but GenetiVear cannot be used for fraud detection and other things.

1961
04:06:52.400 --> 04:07:09.739
Monal Kumar: you don't know why some output is coming in Generative AI, but in machine learning, you exactly have control over that. That control we want, that… for anyone who wants that control, that's why we are providing a solution in stats, machine learning, and deep learning part of it. All right, Kana.

1962
04:07:10.860 --> 04:07:12.010
Monal Kumar: Just wait.

1963
04:07:12.580 --> 04:07:14.839
Monal Kumar: Deeraj, is your question over?

1964
04:07:15.970 --> 04:07:17.260
Dhiraj Chaware: No, hi, hello.

1965
04:07:17.260 --> 04:07:18.810
Monal Kumar: Yeah, hey, Tires, yes.

1966
04:07:18.810 --> 04:07:19.220
Dhiraj Chaware: Can you.

1967
04:07:19.690 --> 04:07:20.450
Monal Kumar: Yes, I can hear you.

1968
04:07:20.450 --> 04:07:38.349
Dhiraj Chaware: So, let me tell you my background. I have completed my BE in mechanical engineering, but I have no corporate experience at all, so I have no domain knowledge about anything related, but I only… I am working as a lecturer from, like, 4 to 5 years or so.

1969
04:07:38.350 --> 04:07:42.259
Monal Kumar: One of my lateral friends, I think 2 months back, got a job as an AI engineer.

1970
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:49.489
Dhiraj Chaware: Okay. So, what do you suggest me? What type of role should I target, to get the job?

1971
04:07:49.490 --> 04:07:51.160
Monal Kumar: Okay, do you know AI right now?

1972
04:07:51.160 --> 04:08:03.930
Dhiraj Chaware: No, nothing. Okay. Just a little bit, let me tell you, just a little bit of Python and some part of, like, libraries like matplot.liband, C1, that's all, that's all I can do.

1973
04:08:03.930 --> 04:08:09.410
Monal Kumar: I told you, right? I think this question I've already answered, but I answered for everyone.

1974
04:08:09.780 --> 04:08:15.650
Monal Kumar: Do you think that this little bit or anything is going to give us a job? What was the answer for this one?

1975
04:08:15.650 --> 04:08:24.200
Dhiraj Chaware: No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, I know. Building a project is very important. Yeah, I have been hearing this for, like, six months or past.

1976
04:08:24.200 --> 04:08:24.710
Monal Kumar: Yes.

1977
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:30.389
Dhiraj Chaware: Second question was related to that, where do I find the projects that, would.

1978
04:08:30.390 --> 04:08:30.920
Monal Kumar: Okay.

1979
04:08:30.920 --> 04:08:35.389
Dhiraj Chaware: You know, shine, out of it, or show my skin.

1980
04:08:35.390 --> 04:08:37.809
Monal Kumar: See, see, I will, I will tell you.

1981
04:08:38.040 --> 04:08:49.079
Monal Kumar: Today is the first day of this course, alright? Right now, you don't even have… no one, no one here does not have understanding of the data science world.

1982
04:08:49.200 --> 04:09:02.529
Monal Kumar: If you don't have an understanding of a world, do you think you will be able to find the problem if you don't have that perspective? So until and unless we don't have a perspective of the data science world, we will not be even able to see the problem statement.

1983
04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:05.499
Monal Kumar: We don't know where the problem exists. Yes?

1984
04:09:05.500 --> 04:09:06.170
Dhiraj Chaware: Okay.

1985
04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:19.520
Monal Kumar: And this is applicable to everyone. So guys, until and unless we have the skill set, you will not be… it's the same thing. If you don't know, English, how you're going to speak with… speak English.

1986
04:09:19.520 --> 04:09:20.609
Dhiraj Chaware: That's super clear, yeah.

1987
04:09:20.860 --> 04:09:24.180
Monal Kumar: Okay? What we want is speaking English, but we don't know English.

1988
04:09:24.430 --> 04:09:25.140
Dhiraj Chaware: Okay.

1989
04:09:25.380 --> 04:09:29.409
Monal Kumar: So, let's learn English, then we will talk about speaking it.

1990
04:09:29.840 --> 04:09:40.209
Dhiraj Chaware: So, also, I have a question. If I have… I'm building a personal project, can I get evaluated with somewhere, in the community, or is there anyone who's able to…

1991
04:09:40.210 --> 04:09:51.920
Monal Kumar: If people are okay with that, you can do that, okay? Okay. But make sure, as I mentioned, do you want to create a project where it is… where you are asking someone

1992
04:09:52.110 --> 04:10:10.020
Monal Kumar: that your project… your project is all over the place. The code is not good, the code is not readable. Do you think that others should even read that project? No. It should be… it should be as simple as possible for the other people to evaluate it. But if it requires others to… 2 hours, 3 hours job, then no one is going to do that.

1993
04:10:10.160 --> 04:10:18.610
Monal Kumar: It should be very simple, and you will learn how to write code so others can read it, other can understand it. I will teach you there. Alright?

1994
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:30.050
Dhiraj Chaware: Okay, so… so a question, like, there are a few suggestions that I've got from internet, like, go with the… at initial stage, go with the Kegel competition, and, so, and then…

1995
04:10:30.050 --> 04:10:30.450
Monal Kumar: I went to Canada.

1996
04:10:30.450 --> 04:10:32.110
Dhiraj Chaware: Go on to the… okay.

1997
04:10:32.110 --> 04:10:51.500
Monal Kumar: I never went to the L competition. It is good if you… it is good for practice and other things, but it is not mandatory. You can think of that as a parallel way if you want to explore, if you have time, but at the initial start, if you go there, all you will be is demotivate. You're going to demotivate yourself, and I'm not able to build something.

1998
04:10:51.840 --> 04:11:08.350
Monal Kumar: So at the initial stage, what you want is little breadcrumbs to feed yourself, be confident, get some dopamine, that you are able to learn something, that you're able to do something. Once you're at that stage, then slowly move forward to the more complex part, but Kaggle, I would not suggest at the start.

1999
04:11:08.960 --> 04:11:14.590
Dhiraj Chaware: Okay. And for resume building, are we going to have a separate session about resume building?

2000
04:11:14.590 --> 04:11:19.570
Monal Kumar: Yes, the resume by building we will do once we know that we can write things in the resume.

2001
04:11:20.360 --> 04:11:28.370
Dhiraj Chaware: Okay. And what about the mock interviews, and are they going to be, AI-based, or, one-to-one,

2002
04:11:28.370 --> 04:11:34.620
Monal Kumar: one-to-one mock interviews, just like this one. By doing one interview, other,

2003
04:11:34.690 --> 04:11:40.549
Monal Kumar: if I'm asking your query, a person who is having a similar query like yours is getting answered also, right?

2004
04:11:40.580 --> 04:11:58.340
Monal Kumar: Yeah. So, mock interview, if someone requires it a lot, then we will do it, but I personally know that at the end of this course, when it is time for the interview and resume, only 2% or 1% people is going to left. Other people just don't complete the course, or they just don't attend at the very, very end.

2005
04:11:58.340 --> 04:12:02.019
Monal Kumar: So, whoever stays till the end, they will be able to get everything.

2006
04:12:02.820 --> 04:12:09.840
Monal Kumar: Alright? But it is not happening in the between. Once we have completed everything, then we will start all of that. Alright?

2007
04:12:09.890 --> 04:12:13.099
Dhiraj Chaware: Also, are we going to have the assignments as well?

2008
04:12:13.100 --> 04:12:13.830
Monal Kumar: requirements I give.

2009
04:12:14.350 --> 04:12:18.790
Monal Kumar: In the previous lecture, if you see in the previous version of Data Science Patch.

2010
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:19.120
Dhiraj Chaware: No.

2011
04:12:19.120 --> 04:12:26.500
Monal Kumar: I give assignments, but there are very few people who does it. So if you do it, then it is totally fine.

2012
04:12:26.830 --> 04:12:31.480
Dhiraj Chaware: So those are just extra, yeah, extra practice for the, because…

2013
04:12:31.480 --> 04:12:33.370
Monal Kumar: It's an extra factor for yourself, see.

2014
04:12:33.370 --> 04:12:49.899
Dhiraj Chaware: Yeah, what I struggle with this, data, database, like, if someone suggests me, like, do MangoDB, practice MangoDB or MyScale, I really, I don't know why. It has happened with, twice, like, I start with the database, but.

2015
04:12:49.900 --> 04:12:51.999
Monal Kumar: Don't worry, I will teach you, okay?

2016
04:12:52.000 --> 04:12:52.760
Dhiraj Chaware: Okay.

2017
04:12:53.060 --> 04:12:53.430
Monal Kumar: True.

2018
04:12:53.430 --> 04:12:54.650
Dhiraj Chaware: Yeah, that's on it.

2019
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:56.680
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure. Thank you very much, Diraj.

2020
04:12:58.730 --> 04:13:09.640
Monal Kumar: And guys, again, I'm repeating, whoever knows the answer of their doubt, I've already answered in some other way, please unraise your hand.

2021
04:13:09.660 --> 04:13:18.980
Monal Kumar: I've already answered majority of the question that I have this X experience and I want to convert it. I already told you that what conversion requires.

2022
04:13:19.160 --> 04:13:24.520
Monal Kumar: And at this stage, right now, what we want is, we want to… Do something.

2023
04:13:24.700 --> 04:13:34.990
Monal Kumar: But to do something, we don't have the skills. So until and unless you don't have the skills, you will not be able to see in the future. So be prepared, I'm still there, and I will be,

2024
04:13:35.190 --> 04:13:47.100
Monal Kumar: solving your queries, but if you think your problem statement can be solved later as well, right now you already have the answer for the base level, please unraise your hand. Alright? Are we clear, everyone?

2025
04:13:48.190 --> 04:13:52.410
Monal Kumar: Because I can see the same questions is there. I know you guys respond to,

2026
04:13:52.490 --> 04:14:10.409
Monal Kumar: ask the question and just want to get a confirmation if I'm in the right path or not, but guys, trust me, this is a universal answer, that you guys will be able to get into the position you want. All you have to do is be a very… be very good at it, solve… if you're able to solve something, people will hire you.

2027
04:14:10.640 --> 04:14:18.619
Monal Kumar: people will hire you. I've seen people transition from HR, I've seen people transition from teacher to AI, it is possible.

2028
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:27.390
Monal Kumar: Are we clear? So guys, again, I am asking you to rethink if your problem statement is already answered, if your question is already answered, then…

2029
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:30.060
Monal Kumar: will start that observation.

2030
04:14:30.460 --> 04:14:37.920
Monal Kumar: Okay? Satesh, can you also create one agent using Microsoft in future? Guys, my… if it is… guys.

2031
04:14:38.190 --> 04:14:57.250
Monal Kumar: For this particular syllabus, it takes 1 year. If we add more things, it will be 1.5 years, 1.2 years. So, our target in this whole course is going to complete the syllabus first. In the meantime, I will teach you more things that is not in the syllabus, alright? If time permits. But our first thing is to complete the syllabus. In depth.

2032
04:14:58.850 --> 04:14:59.970
Monal Kumar: Hari Prasad.

2033
04:15:00.510 --> 04:15:01.570
Monal Kumar: You're next.

2034
04:15:05.520 --> 04:15:06.590
Monal Kumar: Hari Prasad?

2035
04:15:07.080 --> 04:15:07.760
Hariprasath V: Yeah.

2036
04:15:08.420 --> 04:15:08.810
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2037
04:15:08.810 --> 04:15:18.019
Hariprasath V: So, a different kind of topic will be there, Python, machine learning, deep learning. So, when we are going to start with the project, and complete all the topics, each.

2038
04:15:18.020 --> 04:15:27.110
Monal Kumar: No, not complete. If we complete Python, we will complete one Python project. Once machine learning is completed, we will build machine learning. Once deep learning completed, we will build deep learning project.

2039
04:15:27.490 --> 04:15:31.730
Monal Kumar: Hey, Safan, sure. Thanks for joining, Safan. Safan.

2040
04:15:31.930 --> 04:15:32.760
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2041
04:15:32.880 --> 04:15:33.880
Monal Kumar: Reposado?

2042
04:15:34.220 --> 04:15:37.770
Hariprasath V: It's a small, small project, or industry-level project when we start building.

2043
04:15:38.390 --> 04:15:42.440
Monal Kumar: What is… okay, what do you think of, is an industry-level project?

2044
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:44.489
Monal Kumar: What is actually an industrial project?

2045
04:15:44.810 --> 04:15:56.389
Hariprasath V: Yeah, what my understanding in this level is, yeah, it's kind of a real use case we can come to use there with the project completely. So, not only a small kind of thing, so one old feature we can build there like that.

2046
04:15:57.600 --> 04:16:13.859
Monal Kumar: And see, it's… I will tell you, when we are going to do the coding, every project in the industry level, and industry level is something… it's not something that is big, okay? If I talk about, in your phone, there is a to-do list. Is to-do list not usable?

2047
04:16:13.950 --> 04:16:20.580
Monal Kumar: We are not going to build to-do lists, to-do list is not a part of AI Engineer. But Haripher, do you think to-do list is not an industry project?

2048
04:16:21.610 --> 04:16:23.739
Hariprasath V: Yeah, it's a list level only, we can use here.

2049
04:16:23.740 --> 04:16:24.740
Monal Kumar: Yes? Yes.

2050
04:16:24.780 --> 04:16:25.300
Hariprasath V: about that.

2051
04:16:25.300 --> 04:16:39.700
Monal Kumar: So, industry build is something that is maintainable, scalable, and usable. It solves some kind of a problem statement. But it's not like we are going to build an application for NASA, we are not going to build an application for McDonald's.

2052
04:16:40.140 --> 04:16:55.930
Monal Kumar: Industry-level project means problem shipment can be solved. How do we solve it? Are we, noting down every aspects of it for the solution? How are we solving it? How are we approaching it? That approach, that solution, makes it at the industry level. Is everyone clear?

2053
04:16:59.270 --> 04:17:00.679
Monal Kumar: Is everyone clear?

2054
04:17:01.400 --> 04:17:03.490
Monal Kumar: In the chat, guys, is everyone clear?

2055
04:17:07.040 --> 04:17:14.260
Monal Kumar: PhD in Agentech AI, Ravdeep, do you know… all the basics.

2056
04:17:18.360 --> 04:17:21.309
Monal Kumar: Okay, Hari Prasad, does that answer your question?

2057
04:17:23.890 --> 04:17:24.940
Monal Kumar: Different side?

2058
04:17:27.100 --> 04:17:28.529
Hariprasath V: Yeah, it's fine, dear. Thank you.

2059
04:17:28.780 --> 04:17:40.509
Monal Kumar: Sure, don't worry, don't worry. Whatever we will build, it will have a good amount of reasoning there, and which will help you learn. Learning is the main goal, and you will be able to showcase and talk about it in the interviews as well, alright?

2060
04:17:40.890 --> 04:17:42.340
Hariprasath V: Okay, okay, Mo.

2061
04:17:42.340 --> 04:17:43.539
Monal Kumar: Yeah, that's big.

2062
04:17:43.890 --> 04:17:47.430
Monal Kumar: Yes, and we have Kaushik. Kaushik, you're next.

2063
04:17:48.540 --> 04:17:55.969
Monal Kumar: Guys, we still have 56 people in the raised hand. It can be random, in any of the 56 people. Yes, sure.

2064
04:17:55.970 --> 04:18:12.000
Kausik Khanra: Thank you, Manila, and thank you, Krisha, for giving us this opportunity. And I have some basic questions. I was waiting for quite long, but it's not like all these things have been answered already by you. So, the course content has not been discussed yet, right? Because I joined a little bit late.

2065
04:18:12.000 --> 04:18:17.449
Monal Kumar: No, course content, We have provided the syllabus. We have not discussed the syllabus.

2066
04:18:17.820 --> 04:18:18.470
Kausik Khanra: Okay.

2067
04:18:18.470 --> 04:18:24.960
Monal Kumar: So, course content is something which we are talking about, that what is this induction? If you guys have doubt regarding something, this is what we are doing right now.

2068
04:18:25.230 --> 04:18:34.690
Kausik Khanra: Yeah, but, what will be… we'll learn in detail by step by step, like, Chris are discussing in the other sessions, that has not been discussed yet, right?

2069
04:18:34.690 --> 04:18:48.590
Monal Kumar: That we will not do, because if you check, that we already have a YouTube video on that from the Christian, and module a module, once we pick a module, we will start learning all the components. So, the modules that are present in the syllabus, do you know where the syllabus is called?

2070
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:50.709
Kausik Khanra: No, no, no, maybe that's… that's me.

2071
04:18:50.710 --> 04:18:54.359
Monal Kumar: Oh, that's the… okay, do you want the link to the syllabus?

2072
04:18:54.360 --> 04:18:58.239
Kausik Khanra: Yeah, yes, please, or if you can just show me in a quick…

2073
04:18:58.240 --> 04:19:01.500
Monal Kumar: Alright, alright. I will show you because that is better for everyone, alright?

2074
04:19:01.500 --> 04:19:02.950
Kausik Khanra: Yeah, yeah, please, thank you.

2075
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:04.969
Monal Kumar: Yes, thank you for your query.

2076
04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:11.169
Kausik Khanra: And also, one more just little thing. While I'm chatting, is it by intentionally host and the panelists, panelists?

2077
04:19:11.170 --> 04:19:21.070
Monal Kumar: Yes, it is intentionally. Okay, okay. You will only be able to, answer us, not everyone. Okay, sure, no. Just give me a second, okay? Just give me a second.

2078
04:19:55.640 --> 04:19:58.210
Monal Kumar: Here we are, sorry about that.

2079
04:19:58.440 --> 04:20:00.630
Kausik Khanra: Okay, let me share my screen.

2080
04:20:01.350 --> 04:20:02.110
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2081
04:20:02.340 --> 04:20:05.000
Monal Kumar: I hope you're able to see Krishna got in.

2082
04:20:06.380 --> 04:20:06.960
Kausik Khanra: Yep.

2083
04:20:07.200 --> 04:20:09.660
Monal Kumar: Yep, here we have live classes.

2084
04:20:10.030 --> 04:20:10.560
Kausik Khanra: Okay.

2085
04:20:10.560 --> 04:20:29.359
Monal Kumar: And in all of these classes, if you click, you will be able to see the syllabus. But where is the syllabus? Let's go to ours one. This is Ultimate Data Science, right? We will click on this details, then we will go to this details page, right? And here, if you scroll, you will see, just… wait… yeah.

2086
04:20:29.740 --> 04:20:34.280
Monal Kumar: Let me click here. If you click on enroll now, are you able to see this course syllabus?

2087
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:39.299
Kausik Khanra: Yeah, yeah, oh, okay, got it, I have downloaded that before, okay, okay, okay, I got it.

2088
04:20:39.300 --> 04:20:50.259
Monal Kumar: Click on it. Yeah. So here, this is the full thing which we are going to do, module by module. First, we will start with Python foundations. You can see all of these things we are going to learn, everything is in very detail.

2089
04:20:51.070 --> 04:20:52.779
Monal Kumar: These are the topics.

2090
04:20:53.020 --> 04:20:55.230
Monal Kumar: These are the topics.

2091
04:20:55.460 --> 04:20:59.289
Monal Kumar: These are the topics, alright? So this is what we're going to follow.

2092
04:20:59.780 --> 04:21:01.359
Kausik Khanra: Understood. Thank you so much, Mano.

2093
04:21:01.360 --> 04:21:03.160
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, sure. You're welcome.

2094
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:08.920
Monal Kumar: Alright, and then, guys, next… okay, let me…

2095
04:21:09.690 --> 04:21:13.449
Monal Kumar: Kindly share this URL. Guys, I closed it.

2096
04:21:15.160 --> 04:21:16.040
Monal Kumar: share it.

2097
04:21:17.580 --> 04:21:20.229
Monal Kumar: Hi Monol, do you have an official WhatsApp community?

2098
04:21:20.250 --> 04:21:39.159
Monal Kumar: A lazy gamer, as Krisha mentioned, strictly, we should not have any WhatsApp. If Krisha sees that any of us is creating WhatsApp, even me, even you, we are going to get kicked out, okay? So, only the community, we are supposed to chat in community.

2099
04:21:41.370 --> 04:21:42.390
Monal Kumar: Kind of.

2100
04:21:42.850 --> 04:21:44.020
Monal Kumar: Just wait.

2101
04:21:45.860 --> 04:21:48.389
Monal Kumar: Guys, everyone is online, okay?

2102
04:21:51.000 --> 04:21:52.520
Monal Kumar: Okay, Dinesh?

2103
04:21:54.380 --> 04:22:10.080
Dinesh Thakur: Yeah, hi. Hey, Dinesh. My question is related to, first of all, I would like to mention my background. I'm working in Vienna as a solution architect here in one of the, insurance companies. As my background is from the solution architecture.

2104
04:22:10.440 --> 04:22:18.089
Dinesh Thakur: I would like to know, like, how I will position myself after learning these technologies, because I have tried here.

2105
04:22:18.190 --> 04:22:32.450
Dinesh Thakur: outside, because I'm having a data knowledge as well as some of the ML knowledge, so, when I have, when I'm trying outside, they, and putting my… some hands-on projects, which I have completed by my own.

2106
04:22:33.350 --> 04:22:43.280
Dinesh Thakur: I face difficulties, in finding, like, they think, like, how the solution architecture as well as the

2107
04:22:43.960 --> 04:22:46.640
Dinesh Thakur: These hands-on are mixing each other.

2108
04:22:47.120 --> 04:22:55.309
Dinesh Thakur: So, sometimes they… they do not want to, patch up with the things that… how a solution architect can code.

2109
04:22:56.320 --> 04:23:03.719
Dinesh Thakur: if I'm putting the projects, so it is creating the overall different perspective, and that is what I'm…

2110
04:23:03.720 --> 04:23:16.409
Monal Kumar: create a different perspective, okay? For a solution architect, no one is going to look and scroll into the resume where the project section is. What they're going to look into? That what was your previous experience, yes?

2111
04:23:17.230 --> 04:23:32.790
Monal Kumar: And in the previous experience, have you worked with any of these AI or things or not? As I mentioned, that in your current project, or in your previous projects, which you know end-to-end, if you think that there is a place where you could have integrated AI, after learning all of those things.

2112
04:23:32.940 --> 04:23:48.280
Monal Kumar: Write in your resume, and explain it later. It's totally fine. That is how you convert your things. That is the only way you can convert and get into the field. Otherwise, if you'd write nothing relevant, then how you're a relevant profile, first of all? Right, Dinesh?

2113
04:23:48.940 --> 04:23:49.480
Dinesh Thakur: Yeah.

2114
04:23:49.480 --> 04:24:02.129
Monal Kumar: Okay? As a solution architect, your job will be very less in terms of coding. What you will be doing is, you will be sitting in the Git, checking the reviews, doing all of this architect level. This is what your job is.

2115
04:24:02.180 --> 04:24:09.580
Monal Kumar: And for you to do that job well in AI field, what you have to do is, you need to understand

2116
04:24:10.150 --> 04:24:25.569
Monal Kumar: Again, the do's and don'ts of a particular technology, the particular technology stack. In AI, there are a lot of technology stacks. Again, in Python, there are a lot of ways to do, not to do. I think you are well versed with APIs, concurrency, and other things, Dinesh.

2117
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.540
Dinesh Thakur: Thank you.

2118
04:24:26.540 --> 04:24:29.480
Monal Kumar: So, all you need to do is, in your current thing.

2119
04:24:29.940 --> 04:24:44.459
Monal Kumar: add a module of AI, and that's what makes AI as an AI project, in terms of the whole organization level, alright? So understand it, but I will not suggest you to do line by line. Understand it, because,

2120
04:24:44.580 --> 04:24:56.060
Monal Kumar: in terms of review point of all, what should be modd, what should not be, what might create an issue, I think you will be handling more of those. Unfortunately, if you want to write a code, you're already more than a senior politician.

2121
04:24:56.060 --> 04:24:59.249
Dinesh Thakur: Definitely, this is… this is what's happening, because…

2122
04:24:59.250 --> 04:24:59.970
Monal Kumar: It will happen.

2123
04:25:00.060 --> 04:25:12.079
Dinesh Thakur: they, they make the different perspective, even if, I, I saw, like, or when I write in a resume that I am having a hands-on or the, working knowledge with the.

2124
04:25:12.080 --> 04:25:24.049
Dinesh Thakur: With the ML stuff, with these, specific models. So the perspective changes, and that is why I sometimes face difficulties, and I thought, like, deal with that.

2125
04:25:24.050 --> 04:25:32.969
Monal Kumar: the way which you are stuck right now, that is, you want to build something, and you want to build by yourself, I think this perspective, you need to change. I will tell you what you should do, alright?

2126
04:25:33.430 --> 04:25:37.550
Monal Kumar: you can follow it, or you can find some other way, but what I will suggest is that

2127
04:25:37.680 --> 04:25:47.380
Monal Kumar: Anyone who wants to create, create something amazing, or wants to reflect change in the organization, wants revenue, wants profit, anything.

2128
04:25:47.690 --> 04:25:51.859
Monal Kumar: They have to be someone who can drive something.

2129
04:25:52.170 --> 04:25:54.050
Monal Kumar: Alright? Drive something.

2130
04:25:54.340 --> 04:26:08.920
Monal Kumar: And I would suggest you to, focus on profiles, or focus on the next task where you are the one who is driving it, driving it in the sense that, suppose you are a person who is building a new ChatGPT, new OpenAI, right?

2131
04:26:09.160 --> 04:26:15.959
Monal Kumar: If you don't know what you want with the product, what technologies exist, what you will be able to build, can you build ChatGPT?

2132
04:26:17.370 --> 04:26:18.430
Monal Kumar: Finish?

2133
04:26:18.430 --> 04:26:20.250
Dinesh Thakur: Yeah, understood, yeah.

2134
04:26:20.460 --> 04:26:21.970
Monal Kumar: You're getting my point?

2135
04:26:21.970 --> 04:26:22.340
Dinesh Thakur: Yeah.

2136
04:26:22.340 --> 04:26:29.539
Monal Kumar: Developers are good. Having a mindset of developers is also very much required, again, to a certain extent.

2137
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:30.640
Monal Kumar: But…

2138
04:26:30.780 --> 04:26:46.990
Monal Kumar: If developers don't have… developers never have a vision. Developers have a problem statement and a solution. But what separates a leader and other higher positions is they have a vision, they have management expertise to be able to complete it.

2139
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:57.930
Monal Kumar: So I want… I will suggest to you to not go into the development path like you are expecting, but you can do more by leading… by leading and creating something awesome. I think you can.

2140
04:26:57.930 --> 04:26:58.630
Dinesh Thakur: Okay.

2141
04:26:59.050 --> 04:27:00.310
Dinesh Thakur: Okay. I think that is.

2142
04:27:00.310 --> 04:27:01.810
Monal Kumar: That is fairly possible.

2143
04:27:01.970 --> 04:27:02.520
Monal Kumar: Vinish.

2144
04:27:02.520 --> 04:27:04.619
Dinesh Thakur: Yeah. Okay, yeah, sure.

2145
04:27:04.620 --> 04:27:15.200
Monal Kumar: Yeah, so expand your mind, expand your mind in terms of what actually products, what clients need, what might this application need, and try to drive it

2146
04:27:15.690 --> 04:27:20.119
Monal Kumar: By not doing the coding, but by having developers who can do the coding for you.

2147
04:27:21.090 --> 04:27:32.440
Monal Kumar: And that way, you will be able to achieve what you want to build. Say, developer's end goal is, write to code. But writing a code needs to have some bigger purpose, that is, to solve something. And solving and driving that thing is what you should do, Vanish.

2148
04:27:33.120 --> 04:27:35.020
Dinesh Thakur: Yeah. Okay.

2149
04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:38.839
Monal Kumar: I hope that answers your question.

2150
04:27:38.840 --> 04:27:40.090
Dinesh Thakur: Yeah, yeah, thanks a lot.

2151
04:27:42.120 --> 04:27:58.269
Monal Kumar: Yes, guys, if your questions are clear, you guys can drop off. I will see you on Wednesday, okay? And I'm not saying installation, I will decide what is best, because now you guys will be learning from me. I will decide what is best for the Wednesday, but within those 2 hours, we will decide something.

2152
04:27:58.640 --> 04:28:06.430
Monal Kumar: So you will get a mail that what those topics are. Thank you very much for joining, but for others, I will be, yes, guys, I'm not closing the session, I'm asking.

2153
04:28:06.430 --> 04:28:14.830
Dinesh Thakur: If you are there, if you can hear me. Just one more thing. Can you please explain that, subscription for that particular.

2154
04:28:14.940 --> 04:28:15.740
Dinesh Thakur: Okay.

2155
04:28:15.740 --> 04:28:16.240
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2156
04:28:16.240 --> 04:28:21.359
Dinesh Thakur: One, because I have tried the coupon, but it is not working, so how can I get…

2157
04:28:21.360 --> 04:28:26.830
Monal Kumar: the… See, for now, you are getting a free subscription, okay? So, that is,

2158
04:28:27.170 --> 04:28:35.059
Monal Kumar: the coupon will not apply now. MyInster has changed the backend, so if you now sign in, you will get that pro subscription.

2159
04:28:35.230 --> 04:28:36.060
Monal Kumar: Alright?

2160
04:28:36.240 --> 04:28:37.410
Monal Kumar: So, that…

2161
04:28:37.410 --> 04:28:40.330
Dinesh Thakur: With the same email ID, right?

2162
04:28:40.530 --> 04:28:44.509
Dinesh Thakur: Because I have logged in with the same email ID, but it is not working.

2163
04:28:44.510 --> 04:28:52.519
Monal Kumar: Try with the second one, maybe try with a different one, and check it. If not, then, because the backend is already being handled by mine, so maybe try to check with mine in the LinkedIn.

2164
04:28:52.700 --> 04:28:53.170
Monal Kumar: Alright?

2165
04:28:53.170 --> 04:28:54.120
Dinesh Thakur: Book is not a problem.

2166
04:28:54.120 --> 04:29:02.279
Monal Kumar: But yeah, the subscription is, like, in every month, you will get some kind of a credit, alright? So, if you want, you can just try out on the free credits, for now.

2167
04:29:03.300 --> 04:29:04.309
Dinesh Thakur: Okay, yeah, sure.

2168
04:29:04.510 --> 04:29:06.489
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, yes, thanks.

2169
04:29:07.220 --> 04:29:10.820
Monal Kumar: Okay, guys, Wednesday is holiday?

2170
04:29:14.500 --> 04:29:16.550
Monal Kumar: Guys, tell me whether it's holiday?

2171
04:29:17.610 --> 04:29:18.830
Monal Kumar: Data festiva?

2172
04:29:20.900 --> 04:29:29.169
Monal Kumar: It shows free plan. Okay, free plan if it has more limits than it is already a pro plan. All right. Next is Bibu Nayak.

2173
04:29:30.180 --> 04:29:31.699
Monal Kumar: Libu, you're next.

2174
04:29:36.080 --> 04:29:37.100
Monal Kumar: B-boom?

2175
04:29:37.560 --> 04:29:42.019
Monal Kumar: And, after Bibu, it will be Deepak. Bibu, we are not able to hear you.

2176
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:44.609
Monal Kumar: Or I'm not able to hear you.

2177
04:29:47.060 --> 04:29:48.080
bibhu nayak: Hello, am I audible?

2178
04:29:48.080 --> 04:29:50.340
Monal Kumar: Hello? Yes, people, you're already booked.

2179
04:29:51.440 --> 04:30:04.469
bibhu nayak: Yeah, hi, sir. I have a few questions. This is regarding the cloud, technology. Are we using any cloud, technologies, over in this course, so that we can get…

2180
04:30:04.470 --> 04:30:20.680
Monal Kumar: See, everything we will be teaching. In some of the projects, we might use cloud technologies, if you check the syllabus. If that cloud technology, like, let me just go to the bottom, we are not going to learn in depth, but we are going to utilize the cloud technologies for the deployment part.

2181
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:34.170
Monal Kumar: And yes, we will be using cloud technology, as you can see in Module 27, page 31 in this labels. We have AWS EC2, Docker, and other things, so we'll be utilizing a few of those, which is required for AI, alright?

2182
04:30:35.020 --> 04:30:40.830
bibhu nayak: Okay, so this is going to be broadly, discussed about, like, how you gotta deploy our product server.

2183
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:48.320
Monal Kumar: Step by step, we will show that this is exactly what it is used for, this is exactly what we will do, and deployment, alright?

2184
04:30:49.110 --> 04:30:50.940
bibhu nayak: Perfect. Okay, so, oh…

2185
04:30:51.100 --> 04:30:57.319
bibhu nayak: Are we going to learn any data modeling, kind of thing? Like, how we can…

2186
04:30:57.540 --> 04:31:03.110
bibhu nayak: build some data related, like, using MongoDB, as per the requirement, you know.

2187
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:15.310
Monal Kumar: as a data… as an AI engineer, not as a data engineer. As an AI engineer, we don't do data modeling. Data modeling is a part of data engineering where they are creating pipelines for data to flow. That is a part of data engineering.

2188
04:31:15.720 --> 04:31:29.799
Monal Kumar: Alright, so what we will do as a data… as an AI engineer, we will see, because here we also have databases, modules, right? So here we will see how to interact with the database, how to create database, how to do basic schema, how to understand all of that.

2189
04:31:29.970 --> 04:31:30.760
Monal Kumar: Alright.

2190
04:31:31.560 --> 04:31:32.500
bibhu nayak: Okay, so at least we.

2191
04:31:32.500 --> 04:31:34.659
Monal Kumar: I'll be able to work with the database, yes.

2192
04:31:35.120 --> 04:31:46.320
bibhu nayak: Right, right, right. Okay, so actually, in, 5 months, after 5 months, company is providing us, opportunity of data science, project, so… That's great

2193
04:31:46.680 --> 04:31:54.549
bibhu nayak: like, after 5 to 6 months, will I be eligible for the, data science, role, in my current role?

2194
04:31:54.550 --> 04:32:02.839
Monal Kumar: After 5 to 6 months, you will be eligible for machine learning, but if you want to get most out of the 6 months, you can also start something parallelly.

2195
04:32:03.190 --> 04:32:04.110
Monal Kumar: Yes?

2196
04:32:04.560 --> 04:32:11.339
Monal Kumar: But I will suggest you to start something parallelly after… But, in machine learning.

2197
04:32:11.700 --> 04:32:16.900
Monal Kumar: Okay, you have seen that Fast Track video, which Christiana also mentioned, that's 5 videos, right?

2198
04:32:17.140 --> 04:32:30.600
Monal Kumar: In the meantime, Pirelli, if you can learn generative AI from Krisha's playlist, or from any other mentor's playlist, if you can do that, it will help you better, grasp the data science role in 6 months.

2199
04:32:31.490 --> 04:32:36.779
bibhu nayak: Can you quickly tell me the technologies? What should I, know, like, what all are technologies should I…

2200
04:32:36.780 --> 04:32:42.060
Monal Kumar: Now, you should go for, just check Generative BI for NLP.

2201
04:32:42.180 --> 04:32:43.040
Monal Kumar: All right.

2202
04:32:43.810 --> 04:32:44.430
bibhu nayak: Okay.

2203
04:32:44.890 --> 04:32:47.170
Monal Kumar: Genia for NLP, and a RAG system.

2204
04:32:47.730 --> 04:32:51.239
bibhu nayak: RAG. RAG comes with vector database?

2205
04:32:51.240 --> 04:33:02.179
Monal Kumar: So that you will be able to understand it, alright? So if you can target these two, well, then you will be ready in 6 months, because I will be already covering machine learning and NLP for machine learning, right?

2206
04:33:03.580 --> 04:33:06.579
bibhu nayak: Okay, okay, perfect, perfect. Thank you, thank you so much.

2207
04:33:06.669 --> 04:33:08.140
Monal Kumar: Thank you, thank you, Natalie.

2208
04:33:08.410 --> 04:33:10.690
Monal Kumar: And thank you very much, Parvan. Yes?

2209
04:33:11.050 --> 04:33:20.770
Monal Kumar: Thank you very much, following Christians. And guys, I hope that, everyone is getting good answers on their queries. Yes?

2210
04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:23.689
Monal Kumar: And also learning from other queries.

2211
04:33:24.669 --> 04:33:25.640
Monal Kumar: Yes?

2212
04:33:29.460 --> 04:33:44.620
Monal Kumar: All right? And guys, we still have, bookings open, so if you want your friends and colleagues to join this course, you can share the link, and… because still, we have not yet started, okay? They will not be behind. So if you want, you guys can, do that as well, okay?

2213
04:33:44.880 --> 04:33:50.709
Monal Kumar: Because sometimes people ask that after a few days, will we be able to join? Yes, guys, everyone will be able to join.

2214
04:33:51.840 --> 04:33:54.360
Monal Kumar: Deepak, your queries are…

2215
04:33:54.369 --> 04:33:54.839
deepak: Yeah.

2216
04:33:54.840 --> 04:33:57.360
Monal Kumar: hello, pay the buckets.

2217
04:33:57.500 --> 04:34:06.739
deepak: Yeah. So, one of my questions was, like, currently I'm working as a data engineer, and on a day-to-day basis, I work in PySpark, Python, and SQL.

2218
04:34:06.740 --> 04:34:07.580
Monal Kumar: Great.

2219
04:34:07.580 --> 04:34:16.240
deepak: So… I'm just, I was a bit confused. I was looking for this, modern data engineering part.

2220
04:34:16.570 --> 04:34:21.550
deepak: But, I got this one linked.

2221
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:29.519
deepak: And I enrolled here, and just, in this induction call, I got to know, like, the next

2222
04:34:29.610 --> 04:34:43.820
deepak: month, Genai Batch is going to start, so I'm a little confused, like, because currently in my team, the Genai, things has been implemented in the project, and, the data scientist who does work

2223
04:34:43.900 --> 04:34:50.749
deepak: In that, so they don't, really use, male models and all, but, rather they use, Thompson.

2224
04:34:52.360 --> 04:34:52.700
deepak: Yeah.

2225
04:34:52.700 --> 04:34:58.650
Monal Kumar: I understand. So, see, there are… it totally depends on what you want to do, see.

2226
04:34:58.759 --> 04:35:05.229
Monal Kumar: For me, personally, I'm just sharing what I do, okay? It's not a universal fact.

2227
04:35:05.450 --> 04:35:13.700
Monal Kumar: So, what I do personally is that I never check what actually happens in my company and what is it. What I personally do is.

2228
04:35:13.770 --> 04:35:25.919
Monal Kumar: what is the next thing which I am targeting? And that's why I joined some kind of a skill course, to be able to achieve that. So I will ask you one question, that do you want to solve a project

2229
04:35:26.250 --> 04:35:38.619
Monal Kumar: or stay in data engineering, you like data engineering, you want to further improve your data engineering skills, what exactly your goal is? Not the goal in terms of organization, but what exactly

2230
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:43.440
Monal Kumar: You want to see yourself in the next career, in the next career path.

2231
04:35:44.130 --> 04:35:52.170
deepak: Yeah, so my game is, like, I'll stick to data engineering, but I should have a good exposure to Jenai and,

2232
04:35:52.450 --> 04:35:54.700
deepak: The data science part a little bit.

2233
04:35:54.919 --> 04:35:55.639
Monal Kumar: Hmm.

2234
04:35:55.640 --> 04:36:12.930
deepak: Yeah, mostly to Gen AI and Agent AI, because, if you see, a lot of things has been implemented. Currently I'm working in, database, so most of the particles see Genie and all. So those are the inbuilt features of… Gen AI features, being provided by the database.

2235
04:36:12.930 --> 04:36:15.330
Monal Kumar: Understand. See, I will tell you one more thing, okay?

2236
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:25.700
Monal Kumar: the first initial 5 to 6 months of this course, as I mentioned, this will be machine learning, but machine learning is one of the modules which we will cover in 1.5 months.

2237
04:36:25.960 --> 04:36:36.610
Monal Kumar: before machine learning, we have SQL, we have Strats, we have Python, we have all of those things, right? NumPy, Pandas. So…

2238
04:36:36.919 --> 04:36:53.400
Monal Kumar: If you don't want to focus at machine learning at all, I think you should directly go to the generative AI part of it, if you don't want to go to the machine learning. But if you want to stay in… if you want to become, like, an AI engineer or something, then this path is good for you. Otherwise.

2239
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:58.849
Monal Kumar: keep with the data engineering part, and go and learn the generative AI as well.

2240
04:36:59.119 --> 04:37:02.259
Monal Kumar: That is more suitable to you, if that is your goal.

2241
04:37:02.430 --> 04:37:09.420
deepak: Yeah, because, currently, I know, I have good exposure to Python, SQL, and Python.

2242
04:37:09.640 --> 04:37:13.120
Monal Kumar: Hmm. Oh, I was just, just looking at yours.

2243
04:37:13.169 --> 04:37:18.419
deepak: 1.2 levels, so there was, like, almost three and a half months of,

2244
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:24.300
deepak: courses for this Python, SQL, and all those things, so…

2245
04:37:24.300 --> 04:37:24.880
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

2246
04:37:24.880 --> 04:37:25.430
deepak: Yes.

2247
04:37:25.849 --> 04:37:27.209
Monal Kumar: It will take good time, yes.

2248
04:37:28.029 --> 04:37:33.609
deepak: Yeah, so what do you, would you suggest for me, like, shall I go for these data science?

2249
04:37:33.610 --> 04:37:48.209
Monal Kumar: Yeah, I will suggest you to go for generative AI one, because that is what you want to do, right? And that is what everyone is doing on your one, because you're already familiar with the coding part of it, Python, SQL, and other parts, and you're not really that much interested in machine learning.

2250
04:37:48.210 --> 04:37:57.649
Monal Kumar: So go with generative AI, but I am not sure… just check, once this course is out, right, once that course is out, or maybe check with the team that

2251
04:37:57.950 --> 04:38:04.360
Monal Kumar: where the generative AI is starting. If generative AI is starting directly from generative AI, not from the NLP,

2252
04:38:04.509 --> 04:38:06.920
Monal Kumar: Then, you need to learn those things as well.

2253
04:38:07.099 --> 04:38:07.939
Monal Kumar: Depot.

2254
04:38:08.439 --> 04:38:20.810
Monal Kumar: Okay, so maybe check with the team that where exactly that is starting. If it is starting from the intermediate level directly in the generative AI, then the initial months will be a little harder for… to grasp the concepts, right?

2255
04:38:20.810 --> 04:38:22.679
deepak: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is what driver thinks.

2256
04:38:22.689 --> 04:38:31.749
Monal Kumar: Yeah, yeah. So, first check where exactly it is starting. If you have that answer, then check it, or talk with the team that, this is what is going on.

2257
04:38:32.059 --> 04:38:32.869
Monal Kumar: Alright?

2258
04:38:32.999 --> 04:38:34.229
deepak: Sure, thanks, Muller.

2259
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:35.790
Monal Kumar: Yeah, thanks, thanks.

2260
04:38:42.259 --> 04:38:42.960
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2261
04:38:44.040 --> 04:38:47.550
Monal Kumar: Guys, please give some math topic that I have to learn.

2262
04:38:48.599 --> 04:38:51.269
Monal Kumar: Guys, don't worry about the maths topic, lazy gamer.

2263
04:38:52.919 --> 04:39:02.070
Monal Kumar: work with metrics, transpose, and other things, the matrix multiplication part, if you're able to understand, then it is more than fine. VIN and Ayak.

2264
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:03.869
Monal Kumar: Ben and I…

2265
04:39:04.529 --> 04:39:14.180
Monal Kumar: And differentiation, if you want to understand a little bit, just watch a basic video, but differentiation will scare you. Don't worry. I will tell you, just high level, when we are going to learn it, and that's all you need to do.

2266
04:39:14.490 --> 04:39:16.320
Monal Kumar: Got it? Yes, Abhinag?

2267
04:39:16.720 --> 04:39:18.980
Monal Kumar: Hi, yeah. Yes. Hey, evening.

2268
04:39:19.210 --> 04:39:20.319
vinay nayak: Hi, Monica.

2269
04:39:20.320 --> 04:39:20.770
Monal Kumar: Hello.

2270
04:39:20.770 --> 04:39:21.340
vinay nayak: Good afternoon.

2271
04:39:21.500 --> 04:39:22.360
Monal Kumar: Good afternoon.

2272
04:39:22.360 --> 04:39:26.089
vinay nayak: Yeah, so I have a couple of questions with respect to curriculum.

2273
04:39:26.259 --> 04:39:28.410
Monal Kumar: And, application, and.

2274
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:32.930
vinay nayak: future score. So, with respect to curriculum, right,

2275
04:39:33.960 --> 04:39:43.820
vinay nayak: So, yeah, I've seen the curriculum and Silva's part. So, with respect to machine learning, right, you'll be covering all the algorithms.

2276
04:39:45.560 --> 04:39:46.480
vinay nayak: Hurrah.

2277
04:39:46.480 --> 04:39:48.209
Monal Kumar: what algorithms? Whatever is

2278
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:53.879
Monal Kumar: will cover everything, whatever is mentioned in the syllabus. If you check the syllabus, every point is going to be covered.

2279
04:39:54.550 --> 04:40:01.470
vinay nayak: Okay. Suppose, if some things are not covered, and they end up being… in, industry, right? So…

2280
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:02.420
Monal Kumar: That's…

2281
04:40:02.420 --> 04:40:03.240
vinay nayak: you…

2282
04:40:03.240 --> 04:40:08.370
Monal Kumar: Can you give some… I… we can give you a direction, okay?

2283
04:40:08.370 --> 04:40:08.890
vinay nayak: Huh.

2284
04:40:08.890 --> 04:40:17.689
Monal Kumar: But it's… if… to cover that particular algorithm, it might take 2-3 classes, 2-3 classes. In a month, we're not having a lot of classes, right, Vinay?

2285
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:24.980
Monal Kumar: So that part, we will be skipping from the syllabus, but you should not skip. Once you have the basic foundation, you can learn those algorithms.

2286
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:31.389
vinay nayak: Yes, yes, so what I need is, at least if you can mention, right, in future, what else I have to learn.

2287
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:32.060
vinay nayak: Further.

2288
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.910
Monal Kumar: Yep.

2289
04:40:33.190 --> 04:40:34.670
vinay nayak: So, yeah.

2290
04:40:34.670 --> 04:40:35.790
Monal Kumar: Yeah, I will tell you.

2291
04:40:35.930 --> 04:40:42.100
Monal Kumar: What makes me Know that there are newer algorithms.

2292
04:40:42.840 --> 04:40:45.150
Monal Kumar: What is the one difference,

2293
04:40:45.420 --> 04:40:48.550
Monal Kumar: that I know that new algorithms are coming.

2294
04:40:49.200 --> 04:40:50.580
Monal Kumar: What is the one factor?

2295
04:40:51.340 --> 04:40:54.250
vinay nayak: Suppose if I'm unable to solve using current.

2296
04:40:54.810 --> 04:40:56.500
Monal Kumar: Yes, then I will look for new.

2297
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.970
vinay nayak: Yeah.

2298
04:40:57.970 --> 04:41:03.420
Monal Kumar: Yes, so it is me only that I'm looking for new things for a different solution.

2299
04:41:04.170 --> 04:41:04.520
vinay nayak: Yeah.

2300
04:41:04.520 --> 04:41:20.030
Monal Kumar: Yes, so no one is telling me. Similarly, what will happen, that when you're going to solve a particular problem or create a project, something might not work. Then what you will do? You will do some homework, you will do some research, and you will find that this is also being… this is also implementable in the project, let me try it.

2301
04:41:20.460 --> 04:41:25.100
Monal Kumar: Yes? And that's how everyone is going to also know that new things are coming.

2302
04:41:25.740 --> 04:41:36.030
Monal Kumar: Alright? Okay. And also, if you are updated in Krisha's LinkedIn or YouTube, whenever something new comes, the first thing you will see is in Krisha's YouTube channel, right?

2303
04:41:36.570 --> 04:41:42.000
vinay nayak: Okay, yeah. Sure. And also, I'm not from data science or machine learning background.

2304
04:41:42.000 --> 04:41:42.550
Monal Kumar: Thanks.

2305
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:43.140
vinay nayak: So…

2306
04:41:43.140 --> 04:41:44.030
Monal Kumar: Or donations.

2307
04:41:44.210 --> 04:41:50.769
vinay nayak: Maybe, do we get the information of what are the tools that industry generally uses?

2308
04:41:51.380 --> 04:41:54.749
Monal Kumar: That, is in, that we are already teaching.

2309
04:41:54.910 --> 04:42:06.940
Monal Kumar: Okay. Okay. We are teaching the… we are teaching the things which is directly translated… transl, things that are not being even asked.

2310
04:42:07.050 --> 04:42:07.980
Monal Kumar: You already renewed.

2311
04:42:08.380 --> 04:42:15.550
vinay nayak: Okay. And, you mentioned, advanced concepts are covered in different, cores. So, what is that?

2312
04:42:15.550 --> 04:42:18.969
Monal Kumar: No, no, no, no, no, it is advanced. See, if you check the topics, okay.

2313
04:42:19.250 --> 04:42:25.480
Monal Kumar: Mmm… Are you able to ride a vehicle?

2314
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.690
vinay nayak: Yeah.

2315
04:42:27.690 --> 04:42:30.329
Monal Kumar: Yes, you can ride a vehicle. Yes.

2316
04:42:30.330 --> 04:42:30.890
vinay nayak: Yeah.

2317
04:42:30.890 --> 04:42:32.579
Monal Kumar: Can a kid ride a vehicle?

2318
04:42:33.630 --> 04:42:35.080
Monal Kumar: You can drive a vehicle?

2319
04:42:35.400 --> 04:42:46.480
Monal Kumar: Can a kid drive a vehicle? No. No. I'm not saying bike, I'm saying vehicle, okay? Motor vehicle, motor bicycle. Kid cannot drive a motor bicycle, but you can, right? But are you a mechanic?

2320
04:42:47.440 --> 04:42:47.820
vinay nayak: Nope.

2321
04:42:47.820 --> 04:43:01.249
Monal Kumar: Are you a mechanic, okay? So this course will make you a rider. You can write things, you can understand things, you can do, you can do a little bit of fixes. But if you want

2322
04:43:01.450 --> 04:43:19.059
Monal Kumar: to be mechanic of that particular vehicle, of that particular category, because mechanics for a car is different from mechanics for a bike, right? That is what we call a specialization. So, in this particular course, you will see a course from computer vision, you will see NLP, yes? In one of the modules, you will see computer vision.

2323
04:43:19.570 --> 04:43:20.120
vinay nayak: Okay.

2324
04:43:20.120 --> 04:43:32.149
Monal Kumar: So here, computer vision is being covered in maybe 1 month, or maybe 4 lectures, or 8 lectures. But in Krishnik Academy, we also have a specialization of computer vision, which is 6 months of… 6 months long.

2325
04:43:32.460 --> 04:43:43.080
Monal Kumar: So those two are different, but it's not like computer vision, we are teaching you basic. We are teaching you things, but we are not teaching you things like a mechanic for the later part in the course, after 6 months.

2326
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:44.650
vinay nayak: Good idea.

2327
04:43:44.660 --> 04:43:55.349
Monal Kumar: So you will learn things, you will learn things in terms of you will be able to create projects, do interviews, learn everything in detail. But if someone requires a mechanic, then you have to be… do the specialization.

2328
04:43:56.500 --> 04:43:57.130
vinay nayak: Okay.

2329
04:43:57.520 --> 04:43:58.120
Monal Kumar: Are they clear?

2330
04:43:58.120 --> 04:44:00.969
vinay nayak: And, one… yeah, yeah. And one more thing,

2331
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:07.579
vinay nayak: I mean, generally, I mean, if you are using machine learning algorithms, we need to provide bet as input, right?

2332
04:44:07.580 --> 04:44:08.450
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2333
04:44:08.450 --> 04:44:16.080
vinay nayak: So… maybe… I mean, that… how to prepare the data, etc. That will be also thought here.

2334
04:44:17.180 --> 04:44:20.330
Monal Kumar: prepare the… I will tell you how do we get data, okay?

2335
04:44:20.680 --> 04:44:21.070
vinay nayak: Okay.

2336
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:22.969
Monal Kumar: Don't worry, it will be pretty interesting.

2337
04:44:23.330 --> 04:44:24.150
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2338
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:27.900
Monal Kumar: Yep, don't worry, just wait for the main class.

2339
04:44:28.260 --> 04:44:28.600
vinay nayak: Okay.

2340
04:44:28.600 --> 04:44:30.000
Monal Kumar: Alright, yeah, sure.

2341
04:44:30.460 --> 04:44:33.190
vinay nayak: And, one more thing, with respect to…

2342
04:44:33.330 --> 04:44:37.599
vinay nayak: Nowadays, we have Copilot, Cursor, etc. that are being provided.

2343
04:44:37.920 --> 04:44:39.220
vinay nayak: And I've just…

2344
04:44:39.480 --> 04:44:48.380
vinay nayak: when I just tried giving a prompt, right, it was able to generate the code, everything. It almost built some application.

2345
04:44:48.570 --> 04:44:50.049
Monal Kumar: Which I wanted to do.

2346
04:44:50.400 --> 04:44:50.769
Monal Kumar: Yes, sir.

2347
04:44:50.770 --> 04:44:56.020
vinay nayak: So, what will be the scope of future for a ML engineer? I mean.

2348
04:44:56.370 --> 04:44:59.230
vinay nayak: Since you are in the same domain and industry.

2349
04:45:00.370 --> 04:45:15.989
Monal Kumar: Engineers. The scope for people who still remain engineers will stay, will be able to have their job. But people who, who think that, no, I only do computer vision. No, I only do X, I only do Y.

2350
04:45:16.340 --> 04:45:25.829
Monal Kumar: For people who only do certain things, their job will be replaced, because even the managers now can do the coding. Non-tech managers can do the coding as well, yes?

2351
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.650
vinay nayak: Okay.

2352
04:45:27.650 --> 04:45:31.059
Monal Kumar: Yes, but if you're someone who can solve problems.

2353
04:45:31.390 --> 04:45:47.040
Monal Kumar: If you're a problem solver, you can solve business problems, then you will retain your job. I know this is very high level, but once you become coder and see problem in terms of business problems, then that AI cannot do right now.

2354
04:45:47.230 --> 04:45:51.220
Monal Kumar: Okay? Coding AI can do, but solving a problem, AI cannot do.

2355
04:45:52.010 --> 04:45:56.669
Monal Kumar: Directly, okay? You need to… you need to provide the steps. Sure, yeah.

2356
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:58.020
vinay nayak: Okay. Yeah.

2357
04:45:58.830 --> 04:45:59.450
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2358
04:45:59.450 --> 04:46:00.380
vinay nayak: That's it from us, yeah.

2359
04:46:00.380 --> 04:46:01.580
Monal Kumar: Okay, thanks, Renee.

2360
04:46:02.100 --> 04:46:02.760
vinay nayak: Thank you.

2361
04:46:05.200 --> 04:46:08.780
Monal Kumar: Okay, then we have… Tapasini?

2362
04:46:13.760 --> 04:46:14.860
Monal Kumar: That was funny?

2363
04:46:16.270 --> 04:46:18.939
Monal Kumar: K… And then we have Riaz.

2364
04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:20.540
Tapaswini: Hello?

2365
04:46:20.540 --> 04:46:21.769
Monal Kumar: Hey, hey Tapas Finney.

2366
04:46:22.480 --> 04:46:37.140
Tapaswini: Hi. Hi, Monal. So, this is Tapeshvini. So, I'm having, 9 years of experience in IT, and basically, I'm… in my current company, I have already completed 5 years, and I'm giving this domain knowledge,

2367
04:46:37.300 --> 04:46:48.859
Tapaswini: And in this, period, I have worked on AIML, and from last one year, I'm working into Xenia also, where I have worked into RAG and multimodel.

2368
04:46:48.860 --> 04:47:03.039
Tapaswini: But the issue with me is, nowadays I have started using ChatGPT. So most of, like, I'm trying to get the interviews outside, but the issue with me is, like, I'm not getting enough content.

2369
04:47:03.040 --> 04:47:04.170
Monal Kumar: remembering anything.

2370
04:47:04.170 --> 04:47:19.579
Tapaswini: Not able to, yeah, share, like, but I'm working. Currently, I'm working into a lot of projects, but it's like, I'm getting less confidence to, go to outside and give interviews and all, so I'm just thinking to revise.

2371
04:47:19.580 --> 04:47:22.650
Monal Kumar: Have you given an interview? Have you given an interview?

2372
04:47:22.650 --> 04:47:25.959
Tapaswini: I have given interview in Siemens, but I got.

2373
04:47:25.960 --> 04:47:30.559
Monal Kumar: exactly you are facing… what issue you faced in the interview. What they asked.

2374
04:47:30.560 --> 04:47:37.360
Tapaswini: Now, I'm facing issues in coding, because I have moved into a lot from Python.

2375
04:47:37.360 --> 04:47:40.179
Monal Kumar: What coding they were asking? What coding they asked, can you tell me?

2376
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:59.600
Tapaswini: coding, it's a basic coding which they have asked, like, the pyramid-based questions, which we used to do in C. So those kind of questions in Zen AI, they have asked, and they have asked us, other RAG-related, those I have answered, but I failed in my, yeah.

2377
04:47:59.920 --> 04:48:05.769
Tapaswini: But I'm good in, these things, but I'm trying to revise everything, so… but I don't…

2378
04:48:05.770 --> 04:48:09.960
Monal Kumar: You're already good a 90%, okay? Let me tell you, this is what I wanted to tell you.

2379
04:48:10.100 --> 04:48:12.839
Monal Kumar: It's… all you need to do is…

2380
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:29.249
Monal Kumar: revise only the competitive programming, and at least only the basic part. You don't require, you don't require… they will never ask you to write a RAG code or vector database initialization code, they will never do that, right? So you're already good in all the parts.

2381
04:48:29.250 --> 04:48:47.809
Monal Kumar: ChatGPT and Gemini now are a part of a coder's life. They are not going to be removed. This is how now we do coding. Even me, even my managers, even managers' managers, this is how we all do. This is how we can be productive, right? Previously, if you see, to create a particular project, it might take two quarters.

2382
04:48:47.810 --> 04:48:49.369
Monal Kumar: But now it take 4 weeks.

2383
04:48:49.420 --> 04:48:50.330
Monal Kumar: Yes?

2384
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:51.470
Tapaswini: Yeah.

2385
04:48:51.980 --> 04:49:10.019
Monal Kumar: So, that is how the ecosystem now is. But to… for the interviewers to understand, they will never say, write something in the PyTorse, or write a code and do something with the transformer. They will never say that. What they will do is that, because there are a lot of people who don't even know coding, like the basic loop and other things, which

2386
04:49:10.020 --> 04:49:21.070
Monal Kumar: Some people have forgotten, some people don't even know that. So they want to test people that… that does not even know those basic concepts and are relying on AI without even knowing the debugging part of it.

2387
04:49:21.220 --> 04:49:40.699
Monal Kumar: So, that's why this first stage filtering is. I know you know all those concepts which you have not revised, but that's how, things work. Just revise it, make sure… there are maximum 50 questions out there which you need to prepare, not even the DSA part. Only the Python basics part of it. If you can prepare it, you will be good to go.

2388
04:49:41.440 --> 04:49:44.619
Monal Kumar: It cannot… it will not even take 15 to 20 days.

2389
04:49:44.780 --> 04:49:45.789
Monal Kumar: That was funny.

2390
04:49:46.290 --> 04:49:50.300
Tapaswini: Okay. So, can I continue in this long, one year?

2391
04:49:50.300 --> 04:49:56.680
Monal Kumar: You should continue, there is no other view. Oh, okay. Continue in this long one-year course, or what is the other way?

2392
04:49:57.630 --> 04:50:07.060
Tapaswini: Or, can I go with the, other advanced and see, revise any, old videos from, Chris Sears, or… yeah.

2393
04:50:07.060 --> 04:50:19.110
Monal Kumar: See, this one, is different, okay? This particular course, if you check, first check the contents and see what are the things if you don't know. If you know everything, then that's totally fine, but if you don't know, then you should also learn this.

2394
04:50:19.470 --> 04:50:26.230
Monal Kumar: See, me personally speaking, I do know Agent TK, like, I've worked with and created and deployed a lot of solutions also.

2395
04:50:26.420 --> 04:50:33.370
Monal Kumar: But, if you see, there will be some time when a project will come for machine learning. What will happen there?

2396
04:50:34.650 --> 04:50:35.689
Monal Kumar: You getting my point?

2397
04:50:36.190 --> 04:50:55.820
Monal Kumar: ATVI and drag, we can skip it without even knowing in depth, because it's more like a framework which is already built, right? Attach a LLM, do some vector database search, but there is no framework which can do when we have the data, and then applies the model, do all the EDS. It's nothing like that, right?

2398
04:50:56.350 --> 04:50:56.790
Tapaswini: Yeah.

2399
04:50:56.790 --> 04:51:16.560
Monal Kumar: So having that mindset of an ML engineer, that is, EDA, understanding the data, gives you a better understand… gives you… makes you a better problem solver. That is what I have seen. And if you want to do that, then this course, I would suggest everyone to take it, because this gives you more reasoning in terms of understand what data it is.

2400
04:51:18.130 --> 04:51:18.749
Tapaswini: Got it, yeah.

2401
04:51:18.750 --> 04:51:20.810
Monal Kumar: Yep. Yep. Yes.

2402
04:51:20.810 --> 04:51:21.839
Tapaswini: Thank you. Thank you so much.

2403
04:51:21.840 --> 04:51:23.699
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, sure, sure, Taras, you know.

2404
04:51:24.440 --> 04:51:27.609
Monal Kumar: Yes, okay, right.

2405
04:51:28.800 --> 04:51:30.499
Monal Kumar: Then we have…

2406
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:32.310
Riyaz: Liaz?

2407
04:51:32.720 --> 04:51:33.500
Riyaz: Yeah, moral.

2408
04:51:33.500 --> 04:51:34.970
Monal Kumar: Amias. Yes.

2409
04:51:35.560 --> 04:51:37.180
Riyaz: Yeah, sorry. Yeah, thank you.

2410
04:51:37.180 --> 04:51:37.519
Monal Kumar: Not sure.

2411
04:51:37.520 --> 04:51:49.059
Riyaz: I think… I think we… I'm at the right time, because, Sweeney had the question, I'm in the same position, because I've been in industry the last 18 years, but I'm predominantly a tech consultant, and in the last 9 years.

2412
04:51:49.060 --> 04:51:57.610
Riyaz: working as a product manager in data analytics, but I already have that gist of building good products. That's what I've been doing as a product manager, but not as a developer.

2413
04:51:57.680 --> 04:52:14.840
Riyaz: So I made additional last 6 months that I want to be a big… that gives me happiness, like, I want to build some products myself. So that's how I want to become a very good AI software engineer. So I started 6 months back, learning Python and do some white coding using,

2414
04:52:15.140 --> 04:52:27.459
Riyaz: ChartGPT codecs, and then I built, MCP and LLMs, and then some RAG, but I didn't get the same conference, like, I don't have basics, that's why I've come here.

2415
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:33.319
Riyaz: That's my goal. I want to continue this, one-year course, I want to build strong foundations.

2416
04:52:33.320 --> 04:52:34.439
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, you would have.

2417
04:52:34.440 --> 04:52:44.869
Riyaz: My ultimate goal is to become a very good AI software engineer, and want to crack a job in high-tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft.

2418
04:52:44.870 --> 04:52:45.190
Monal Kumar: Monet.

2419
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:47.339
Riyaz: goal. That's my… I have a clear goal.

2420
04:52:47.340 --> 04:52:48.710
Monal Kumar: That's great, that's very awesome.

2421
04:52:48.710 --> 04:52:49.610
Riyaz: time… Yes.

2422
04:52:49.960 --> 04:52:53.159
Riyaz: Yeah, so is this right direction? Is this course.

2423
04:52:53.160 --> 04:53:04.930
Monal Kumar: It is… it is… it is the right direction, because you need to have your base clear. Base in terms of… because when you go to that company, they will not just ask you to use something. What happens if you want to build something?

2424
04:53:05.410 --> 04:53:08.749
Monal Kumar: Build something like a framework, like a langchain, then what you will do?

2425
04:53:08.820 --> 04:53:27.089
Monal Kumar: Right? So to have that understanding, you need to be on the base level. But for… to go to those companies, I will also suggest you to work very hard on the DSA part, because if you know everything, you can build your own land gen framework, but you cannot get the DSA round.

2426
04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:31.550
Monal Kumar: that company cannot evaluate your skills of AI, right?

2427
04:53:31.760 --> 04:53:35.200
Monal Kumar: That is the first stage itself. So, in parallel, start the DSA.

2428
04:53:36.250 --> 04:53:36.890
Riyaz: Thank you.

2429
04:53:37.140 --> 04:53:49.420
Riyaz: I understand. That's why I'm… I was looking… I did myself last 6 months alone, but I understand now I really need a meta, I need a direction, so I'm glad that I found you… you all. I think I started right…

2430
04:53:49.420 --> 04:53:49.770
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2431
04:53:49.770 --> 04:53:54.180
Riyaz: you can… you can guide and mentor me, right? So, I have time and commitment.

2432
04:53:54.180 --> 04:54:07.669
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes, we are here, yes, alright? In every doubt session, you see, this is the day one, and you will see the same energy in every day, alright? It's not like we are only going to take the doubt session this time and going to skip it, no.

2433
04:54:07.940 --> 04:54:21.479
Monal Kumar: We are always going to do it. So, let's suppose after one month, you made some progress, not just this course, I will not suggest to always stick in a course, but always do some side quests, which will help you achieve that final goal, right?

2434
04:54:21.730 --> 04:54:22.130
Riyaz: Peace.

2435
04:54:22.130 --> 04:54:27.469
Monal Kumar: So, do that side quest, if you face some difficulty, or if you think that you're feeling a little lost.

2436
04:54:27.690 --> 04:54:36.629
Monal Kumar: just raise your hand in the out session, we will do something, I will do my homework sometime. I might not… I might not have the solution at present.

2437
04:54:36.870 --> 04:54:43.520
Monal Kumar: at that time, but I might do some homework and can give you some guidance later. You're also here, I'm also here, yes?

2438
04:54:44.610 --> 04:54:51.839
Riyaz: I'm very glad I phoned you, because I based out in London, and then I always go around people, and then I never had a…

2439
04:54:51.850 --> 04:54:54.230
Monal Kumar: Right. Yes, I can totally understand you.

2440
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:59.650
Riyaz: mindset. I think I found Krisha, and then you all, I think I have very good confidence now. Thank you.

2441
04:54:59.650 --> 04:55:03.309
Monal Kumar: Yes, 2020, yes, the two will be converted. Yes.

2442
04:55:03.310 --> 04:55:03.810
Riyaz: Thank you.

2443
04:55:04.870 --> 04:55:05.610
Monal Kumar: That's great.

2444
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:15.640
Monal Kumar: All right, and okay, Muhammad, Shajil… Hey, Manuel, just want to ask, as I have M1, so it is good. That is…

2445
04:55:17.500 --> 04:55:24.499
Monal Kumar: I also have M1, I can do all the machine learning in my system. For any GPU or something that you require.

2446
04:55:24.560 --> 04:55:38.549
Monal Kumar: For any GPU we require, we as AI engineers, or soon to become AI engineers, we have a lot of other options. For the tasks which require GPU, we can use other cloud sources for free.

2447
04:55:38.800 --> 04:55:42.480
Monal Kumar: And then train the model and bring it back to our system.

2448
04:55:42.650 --> 04:55:54.229
Monal Kumar: So, don't really commit to any hardware right now. This is the initial phase. Later, if you feel that you require a better hardware, decide it later. For now, don't do anything.

2449
04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:57.289
Monal Kumar: Muhammad, are we clear? Yes.

2450
04:55:57.700 --> 04:56:00.099
Monal Kumar: So, guys, hardware constraint…

2451
04:56:00.850 --> 04:56:11.799
Monal Kumar: even if you don't do coding side-by-side, just look at the lecture. After 2-3 months, if you think that now I feel like I understand code, because, guys, I will tell you one interesting thing.

2452
04:56:12.010 --> 04:56:14.659
Monal Kumar: when I started learning coding,

2453
04:56:14.890 --> 04:56:29.860
Monal Kumar: my mentor taught me so well that I was not even practicing code at the home. I was like, okay, I understand things. But yes, without doing the actual hard coding, actual coding in your system, you will not gain that speed and understanding.

2454
04:56:29.860 --> 04:56:39.009
Monal Kumar: But for a few initial months, everyone can deal with it by just even looking at the lectures. This is what I have personally felt while learning the coding.

2455
04:56:39.980 --> 04:56:40.790
Monal Kumar: Okay?

2456
04:56:41.460 --> 04:56:45.179
Monal Kumar: So, yes, and then Akshay?

2457
04:56:48.010 --> 04:56:50.170
Akshay Gajarlawar: Hey, man. Hey, Chris, thank you so much.

2458
04:56:50.840 --> 04:56:51.740
Akshay Gajarlawar: Yep.

2459
04:56:52.290 --> 04:56:54.909
Akshay Gajarlawar: Good afternoon, and thank you so much, Pravam, for…

2460
04:56:54.950 --> 04:57:12.569
Akshay Gajarlawar: providing us the platform to collaborate and learn. Just to give you a background, I'm a mobile application developer with 10 years of experience, and the primary reason why I opted in for this program is just to expand my skills, but at the same time, I'm curious to know

2461
04:57:12.750 --> 04:57:15.209
Akshay Gajarlawar: Will we cover,

2462
04:57:15.450 --> 04:57:29.450
Akshay Gajarlawar: the API part in this course, like Django or FastAPI, so that we will have the endpoint, and that endpoint I will be consuming in my mobile application as an experiment, as we progress through the course.

2463
04:57:30.720 --> 04:57:39.530
Monal Kumar: See, FastAPI specifically, we don't have a module for that, okay? But from the Python background, I'm also… obviously, I'm from Python background.

2464
04:57:39.580 --> 04:57:49.610
Monal Kumar: having an API is not a big deal, okay? And what I'm going to do, I've already, thought about a lot of things, that I will be creating a few lectures in my personal YouTube.

2465
04:57:49.610 --> 04:58:01.100
Monal Kumar: which is not present in this section, which you guys can refer it later. So once we have some kind of understanding, in the meantime, I will create those and upload those in my channel, so that everyone can refer it, whatever the lecture is required. Alright?

2466
04:58:01.360 --> 04:58:02.469
Monal Kumar: That'll be good.

2467
04:58:03.000 --> 04:58:05.140
Monal Kumar: Yep, thank you. Yes, sure.

2468
04:58:05.670 --> 04:58:22.700
Akshay Gajarlawar: Yeah, and another question was the same, like, a lot of us are in a transition mood, but is there anything, like, apart from whatever you just told, specifically for the mobile developer? Do you, like, if I want to transition, maybe,

2469
04:58:23.310 --> 04:58:29.029
Akshay Gajarlawar: Creating a portfolio, and yeah, primary focus will obviously be learning, but is there anything…

2470
04:58:29.030 --> 04:58:34.120
Monal Kumar: You know end-to-end things of it. Once you learn this AI, alright, what you can do, you can…

2471
04:58:34.290 --> 04:58:49.670
Monal Kumar: you can be an AI engineer, alright? That you can make it as a primary, or make an application developer as primary. What you can also do is that, because you know applications and can create applications, you can also do a lot of freelancing and create a product of your own in your phones, right?

2472
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:50.220
Akshay Gajarlawar: Okay.

2473
04:58:50.220 --> 04:58:52.100
Monal Kumar: So, because you have…

2474
04:58:52.120 --> 04:59:11.399
Monal Kumar: I'm totally jealous of people who know this front-end and back end of the front end also, that whole application part of it. That part I want to learn, but still, I don't have… I'm not getting that time. But because I know AI, I know what things people want that can be integrated into the mobile application, right?

2475
04:59:11.450 --> 04:59:23.069
Monal Kumar: So, why not? So, you have a lot of endless possibilities, and it is a good thing that you already know that. This is, your side quest kind of a thing, that you want to acquire more skills on top of your application development skills, right?

2476
04:59:23.070 --> 04:59:23.700
Akshay Gajarlawar: Yeah.

2477
04:59:23.700 --> 04:59:29.439
Monal Kumar: So, you will… you can do a lot of things. So, I'm also eager to know what are the possibilities you're going to create

2478
04:59:29.760 --> 04:59:31.439
Monal Kumar: From this one. Yep.

2479
04:59:31.440 --> 04:59:43.750
Akshay Gajarlawar: Yeah, whatever the use cases that we will learn, I will definitely try to have those used on the mobile. That's how I'm planning right now. But yeah, we'll revisit this topic as we go. Sure, sure.

2480
04:59:44.040 --> 04:59:45.470
Monal Kumar: Yeah, thank you very much, actually.

2481
04:59:47.200 --> 04:59:54.719
Monal Kumar: Alright, and, okay, Rushna, I'm coming from a cloud DevOps, I will overhammer, kindly help me clarify.

2482
04:59:55.360 --> 05:00:08.630
Monal Kumar: Coming from a cloud DevOps sector, so I have the automation skill, I don't have heavy development experience. Once construction, I will showcase every topic as we go. Guys, I will show… I will teach you coding in such a manner that no one will face any issue.

2483
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:14.889
Monal Kumar: Okay? After 6 months, as you can… as Chris already told you, Data Science Batch 1 is already going on.

2484
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:27.590
Monal Kumar: None of my students complain about the coding part. Everyone is familiar with coding and confident with coding when they are jumping to the deep learning part. And you can even build more big stuff, so don't worry about it.

2485
05:00:27.930 --> 05:00:32.280
Monal Kumar: Okay? The development part, I will give you that mindset. That is my goal.

2486
05:00:33.120 --> 05:00:33.920
Monal Kumar: Alright?

2487
05:00:34.580 --> 05:00:38.389
Monal Kumar: Sure, yes, thank you very much. And Sumit, Sumit Sankar Das.

2488
05:00:38.640 --> 05:00:43.419
Monal Kumar: After Sumit, there will be… it will be Sandeep Shukla. But Sumit, you're first.

2489
05:00:45.710 --> 05:00:46.710
Sumit Shankar Das: Hi, Munel.

2490
05:00:46.710 --> 05:00:47.090
Monal Kumar: Excellent.

2491
05:00:47.360 --> 05:01:05.330
Sumit Shankar Das: And, yeah, thanks to everyone for bringing up the questions. I think most of mine are answered already, but I have a, you know, specific one. So, about my background, I'm into integration, like, and I work in product, like, different products, like Oracle, Millsoft, and Workday, this suite of tools.

2492
05:01:05.530 --> 05:01:24.199
Sumit Shankar Das: I have a little bit experience in Python, JavaScript, and Java as well, and SQL, so… but not an expert, and not into those libraries and all those things that we are gonna use. So, I thought that the traditional route might be good for me, but I also wanted to know, like.

2493
05:01:24.260 --> 05:01:32.839
Sumit Shankar Das: is the traditional route, and I'm happy to continue here and in parallel, explore things from the Udemy or other things that we discussed.

2494
05:01:32.840 --> 05:01:45.879
Sumit Shankar Das: But I wanted to understand, like, for… in order to understand and master Lama Index or, langchain, LangGraph, is it, like, these things are a prerequisite, or I can start them off in parallel?

2495
05:01:47.320 --> 05:01:50.619
Monal Kumar: It is not a pre… you're talking about generating BI?

2496
05:01:51.360 --> 05:01:52.830
Sumit Shankar Das: Yeah, I mean, like.

2497
05:01:52.830 --> 05:02:06.059
Monal Kumar: See, Llama Index and other things are like a framework where you combine LLMs and create a workflow from them. You can create an agentic workflow, so that is more in terms of… more around this agentic workflow.

2498
05:02:06.380 --> 05:02:08.230
Monal Kumar: Okay, or LLM workflow.

2499
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:26.449
Monal Kumar: But before that, there is also a RAG, okay? And generative AI is not just RAG and agentic AI. Genetic AI is a lot of things, alright? There are a lot of bigger elements which does something that can be any kind of a job. That is also part of generative AI. So,

2500
05:02:26.490 --> 05:02:31.520
Monal Kumar: Llama and other things is good to target for the newer projects, but as I mentioned.

2501
05:02:31.790 --> 05:02:39.200
Monal Kumar: If we only target a very specific part of AI, we are restricting ourselves, for a very small thing.

2502
05:02:39.440 --> 05:02:53.110
Monal Kumar: We might work there for 2 years, but if you want to learn something new, we might again feel restricted that I don't know deep learning, I don't know basic NLP. How to improve the performance of my model. Are you getting my point, Sumer?

2503
05:02:53.430 --> 05:03:02.760
Sumit Shankar Das: Yeah. No, so I'll, like, I'm more than happy to continue in this current traditional route, because I know, like, agent EKI or EI agents, those things.

2504
05:03:02.760 --> 05:03:05.670
Monal Kumar: You're asking the prerequisite for generative part, right?

2505
05:03:05.670 --> 05:03:17.129
Sumit Shankar Das: Yeah, I'm just asking if I can, you know, in parallel, once we get the Udemy access, if I can start LangChain and Langgraph, and if they need anything from… as a prerequisite, like, apart from Python.

2506
05:03:17.130 --> 05:03:26.860
Monal Kumar: The Langchain Langraph, personally, for me, does not have any prerequisite, okay? You can directly start learning those frameworks, like Langchain, first start with Langchain.

2507
05:03:27.010 --> 05:03:35.269
Monal Kumar: And those are, a part of AI. Once the AI is created, what we will do with this AI is kind of that direction.

2508
05:03:35.610 --> 05:03:46.430
Monal Kumar: It is not about creating LLMs, it's about using LLMs, using the frameworks, and creating workflow. So, that does not require a prerequisite for those. Yep, you can use it.

2509
05:03:46.430 --> 05:03:48.030
Sumit Shankar Das: Python would be required, right?

2510
05:03:48.030 --> 05:03:52.199
Monal Kumar: Python will be required, yes. Python is the language which we use in AI. Python will be required.

2511
05:03:52.590 --> 05:03:59.400
Sumit Shankar Das: Okay, then once that we are, done with the Python part, maybe I'll kickstart that from the Udemy, so that…

2512
05:03:59.400 --> 05:04:00.090
Monal Kumar: Thanks.

2513
05:04:00.500 --> 05:04:13.269
Sumit Shankar Das: There's a requirement for Langchain and Langraph in my organization, so maybe, yeah, I'll do that. But yeah, I'm more than happy to take the traditional route, because I know machine learning and these things are the important.

2514
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:16.129
Monal Kumar: It will open your brain. Okay, it will open your reasoning.

2515
05:04:16.130 --> 05:04:16.580
Sumit Shankar Das: Have a seat.

2516
05:04:16.580 --> 05:04:17.340
Monal Kumar: data.

2517
05:04:17.340 --> 05:04:26.700
Sumit Shankar Das: My manager also says that this should be the path that I should take if I want to learn, because everything, in the… like, whatever the business problems are, everything don't need AI.

2518
05:04:26.700 --> 05:04:27.960
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2519
05:04:27.960 --> 05:04:36.750
Sumit Shankar Das: We need to understand where AI fits in and where ML and the other components fits in, if I want to move into an AI architect sort of space.

2520
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:39.340
Monal Kumar: Exactly. Yes, sure, that's great, Suman.

2521
05:04:40.120 --> 05:04:48.309
Sumit Shankar Das: Thanks, and, would we… the… I think Rishi was showing some, projects, right, earlier. Okay.

2522
05:04:48.310 --> 05:04:49.750
Monal Kumar: Yeah, that is a project.

2523
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:50.100
Sumit Shankar Das: Yeah, buddy.

2524
05:04:50.100 --> 05:04:53.580
Monal Kumar: Pro, that is coming in 22nd.

2525
05:04:53.910 --> 05:04:56.550
Sumit Shankar Das: Okay, of this month, that is a different product.

2526
05:04:57.750 --> 05:05:07.809
Monal Kumar: So maybe that is not relevant for us right now, right? Once we are covering all these things… That also has Python projects, that also has machine learning, that teaches you more, like.

2527
05:05:07.980 --> 05:05:13.340
Monal Kumar: Yes, you know, machine, yes, that is not relevant for the student of this class, because right now we are not ready.

2528
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:21.009
Sumit Shankar Das: Yeah, yeah. Okay, maybe once this… we are covering the, you know, important parts, then we'll sync up and we'll see what all I can pick up from there.

2529
05:05:21.010 --> 05:05:21.970
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

2530
05:05:22.240 --> 05:05:23.279
Sumit Shankar Das: Okay, thanks, thanks, Marlon.

2531
05:05:23.280 --> 05:05:27.910
Monal Kumar: Yep. Thanks, Lynch Alright, and then we have Sandeep Shukla.

2532
05:05:29.240 --> 05:05:31.569
sandeep shukla: Hi, Manil. Hope I'm audible.

2533
05:05:31.930 --> 05:05:33.480
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, you're already booked.

2534
05:05:34.050 --> 05:05:42.189
sandeep shukla: Yeah, first of all, thanks to you. I understand it might be a taxing day for you, answering so many questions for us.

2535
05:05:42.340 --> 05:05:43.010
sandeep shukla: Yeah.

2536
05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:46.730
Monal Kumar: No, it is totally fine, yeah. It is my responsibility someday. Yeah, thanks.

2537
05:05:47.390 --> 05:06:00.950
sandeep shukla: Yeah, so, just to tell you, I actually have, around 18 years of experience, and, my basically, role is into QA, quality assurance.

2538
05:06:01.130 --> 05:06:16.690
sandeep shukla: And, just to assure one of your points as well, it will be beneficial for all of them attending as well. I recently spoke to head of, our analytics department regarding what kind of people they are looking to hire.

2539
05:06:16.870 --> 05:06:30.880
sandeep shukla: So, what he told me is, they are least bothered about certification, or what kind of, degrees people have, but they are more into looking into projects, what kind of projects people have worked into.

2540
05:06:30.880 --> 05:06:50.860
sandeep shukla: And, whether the problem statement they are facing or they are looking to solve, does, the project, the project has already addressed it, or, he has the capability to address it. So that is where the industry is moving. It's moving away from degrees and certificates to projects.

2541
05:06:50.860 --> 05:06:51.869
Monal Kumar: I'm on point, right?

2542
05:06:51.870 --> 05:06:53.610
sandeep shukla: capability.

2543
05:06:53.610 --> 05:06:56.600
Monal Kumar: capability? Exactly, exactly.

2544
05:06:56.600 --> 05:07:11.980
sandeep shukla: You hit the nail. So, my question was, basically, I'm into QA, and the route that I was willing to take, so I just, appeared for my Master's of Data Science examination in December.

2545
05:07:11.980 --> 05:07:12.470
Monal Kumar: Nice.

2546
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:22.630
sandeep shukla: So I would be completing that. Most possibly, I'll be getting my master's degree. So I have a basic understanding of the machine learning, the maths behind it.

2547
05:07:22.760 --> 05:07:24.680
sandeep shukla: the NLP and so.

2548
05:07:24.910 --> 05:07:27.980
sandeep shukla: But, first is…

2549
05:07:27.980 --> 05:07:33.579
Monal Kumar: that understand that they don't teach you the mindset of an engineer. It's more like a core syllabus.

2550
05:07:34.130 --> 05:07:53.009
sandeep shukla: So, my question was, when I spoke to, one of my… so, when I was having conversation with, the head, he said, like, why don't you look into somewhere into, QA part of, QA and RISC part into, your ML and, GenAir.

2551
05:07:53.010 --> 05:07:53.390
Monal Kumar: What is this?

2552
05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:59.479
sandeep shukla: Because that is what is the upcoming problem. Because building… It is a problem.

2553
05:08:00.750 --> 05:08:14.119
sandeep shukla: Building GenAI and everything, we have a lot of resources that would be coming in the college pass-outs. They would be coding and building GenAI machines, or integrating Gen AI into their workflows.

2554
05:08:14.120 --> 05:08:25.179
sandeep shukla: So, that shouldn't be much of a problem. The problem lies in, how do we, build proper quadrills, how do we make sure to reduce hallucination

2555
05:08:25.180 --> 05:08:49.329
sandeep shukla: How do we make sure that, the testing part, wherein if we are testing through LLM, how do we reduce the cost, of testing, the implemented LLMs? Because, testing quite… testing costs might go high. How do we build, valid synthetic data for our testing? So that is something where you should be looking into, because that is where I see maximum problems.

2556
05:08:49.330 --> 05:08:56.810
Monal Kumar: There is one very big problem statement now because of generative AI, that is LLM evaluation. This evaluation that you are seeing, right?

2557
05:08:57.160 --> 05:09:08.639
Monal Kumar: The systems are built, but now there is a very vague metric to tell that this way of modeling

2558
05:09:08.640 --> 05:09:21.289
Monal Kumar: Or this model works. Model, I'm not saying ML model, but I'm saying that this whole process that we created, product that we created, works. There is no way to tell that it is performing better, because nothing's… nothing is being compared, right?

2559
05:09:21.370 --> 05:09:29.199
Monal Kumar: So, it is all, it is really a problem statement, and industry is still looking at it. There is no real solution.

2560
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:44.699
Monal Kumar: So what you can do, in the meantime, you can learn Python, create good testing suits from the Python test sets, understand what LLM solution, maybe create… maybe in future, you can create our own framework which helps us all of these things. Right, Sandeep?

2561
05:09:44.870 --> 05:09:47.469
Monal Kumar: But yes, there is a very big scope here.

2562
05:09:47.880 --> 05:09:54.409
Monal Kumar: But I will suggest to have that scope in the mindset, but in the meantime, also have a mindset of the engineer, because

2563
05:09:54.860 --> 05:10:03.480
Monal Kumar: At the end, what we want is, we don't want to be, stuck in a loop which management created for us, because sometimes it is a loop.

2564
05:10:03.580 --> 05:10:11.150
Monal Kumar: They want to fill certain positions, and if we have a person in-house, let's tell them to do that.

2565
05:10:11.360 --> 05:10:17.730
Monal Kumar: We want, we want to be in a place where it feels like this is what we want to do.

2566
05:10:17.810 --> 05:10:20.870
Monal Kumar: Okay? So if you feel like testing is your way.

2567
05:10:20.930 --> 05:10:37.559
Monal Kumar: So, think in terms of direction, once you understand the evaluation of machine learning models and deep learning models, it will give you a better clarity of what actually is evaluation. And once you understand transformers, which will happen later in this course, not by me, then you will understand that, oh.

2568
05:10:37.560 --> 05:10:44.440
Monal Kumar: LLMs generate data like this, that's why we need to think of an evaluation which suits the LLMs.

2569
05:10:45.240 --> 05:10:45.830
sandeep shukla: Hmm.

2570
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:55.609
Monal Kumar: So, you will get there. But yeah, that is a pretty good way, because even I was working in LLM evaluation, I was creating that, and it is still a problem.

2571
05:10:55.780 --> 05:10:56.590
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2572
05:10:57.480 --> 05:10:59.120
Monal Kumar: So.

2573
05:10:59.120 --> 05:11:11.200
sandeep shukla: In addition to this route, do you think, like, I should go for AI Pro part, or should I also enroll for the advanced course? What do you suggest?

2574
05:11:11.200 --> 05:11:24.529
Monal Kumar: I think later, because later you do need to go to the RAG part, okay? Without RAG, how RAG works, because the matching, the cosine similarity, you will learn later. The matching that you're doing with the RAG systems and other, the retrieval that is happening.

2575
05:11:24.540 --> 05:11:35.120
Monal Kumar: There, also, the evaluation now is coming that whether it is even correct or not. So, RAG is also something which you require. RAG also, we are covering in this course, let me search for it.

2576
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:37.739
Monal Kumar: Just a minute.

2577
05:11:38.360 --> 05:11:39.200
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2578
05:11:39.350 --> 05:11:54.159
Monal Kumar: So, RAG also is something which we are, teaching here, but I think what I will suggest is that for you to first complete this course, and if you feel like, I want to go in depth after certain months, 6 months, 7 months.

2579
05:11:54.160 --> 05:12:03.040
Monal Kumar: Then, jump to the next part, but not now. I think you will be able to understand the retrieval. Understand the problem first, and problem you will understand from this course.

2580
05:12:03.090 --> 05:12:03.950
Monal Kumar: Yes?

2581
05:12:04.880 --> 05:12:11.450
Monal Kumar: If you do everything in parallel, you will feel like there are thousands of things to solve, then you will be all over the place.

2582
05:12:12.340 --> 05:12:13.600
sandeep shukla: Right?

2583
05:12:13.600 --> 05:12:20.769
Monal Kumar: So start creating kind of an evaluation model for machine learning, deep learning, then jump to the LLM, so you will have an understanding of those suits.

2584
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.600
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2585
05:12:21.600 --> 05:12:30.989
sandeep shukla: Yeah, Bishop, because, I actually am studying… sorry, but, sorry to take more… more of your time. I'm studying… studying basics from a long time.

2586
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:45.290
sandeep shukla: And, I did, see the video, that was created by Chris, where he explained that, a hybrid model, so there is where you learn from basics, so I know most of the basics.

2587
05:12:45.290 --> 05:13:01.059
sandeep shukla: Then you have, just, for leaders, what you want to learn for leaders, and one is a hybrid model, the third model, wherein you go, like, you learn, the basics as well, try to make, sure that you learn more about basics.

2588
05:13:01.160 --> 05:13:10.889
sandeep shukla: And then, so, I think parallel, because even after, only after his advice, I started, because I was getting into the loop of studying the basic.

2589
05:13:10.890 --> 05:13:12.530
Monal Kumar: That is a link, yeah.

2590
05:13:12.530 --> 05:13:22.459
sandeep shukla: And I was not able to implement much. So, and with my experience, 18 plus of experience, if I don't implement things, just learning the basics won't suffice.

2591
05:13:22.460 --> 05:13:23.490
Monal Kumar: No, it's okay.

2592
05:13:23.490 --> 05:13:26.979
sandeep shukla: Parallel, I thought, going parallelly was the best thing.

2593
05:13:26.980 --> 05:13:27.340
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2594
05:13:27.340 --> 05:13:32.859
sandeep shukla: Where I revisit my basics where I need to, but I implement things as well.

2595
05:13:32.950 --> 05:13:35.699
Monal Kumar: Okay, so I will suggest you one thing, okay?

2596
05:13:36.740 --> 05:13:52.330
Monal Kumar: to first check with the team that, whether, the pricing of AI Pro suits you or not, alright? If that is okay, what I will suggest is that while you're working on a parallel course of RAG or generative AI, okay?

2597
05:13:52.330 --> 05:13:57.649
Monal Kumar: rack or agent TKI system kind of thing, okay? We already have a course on RAC and agents, right?

2598
05:13:57.740 --> 05:14:12.759
Monal Kumar: So, check with those parallel courses. In the meantime, because you also want to get the skills of developing something from the Python, right? Start creating an evaluation framework, start with machine learning.

2599
05:14:12.820 --> 05:14:29.090
Monal Kumar: And in the meantime, because you're learning the RAG and agents also, you know the problem statement that you are, that they have, then once that few machine learning evaluation testing suits you are able to create, then it creates for RAG and thinking that they're in the direction. So, what will happen? You are learning

2600
05:14:29.140 --> 05:14:34.959
Monal Kumar: And you're doing practicals in machine learning. Once this is done, then you're also doing the practicals in RAG for the evaluation part.

2601
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:37.110
Monal Kumar: Yes?

2602
05:14:37.250 --> 05:14:38.669
sandeep shukla: Okay, okay, sure.

2603
05:14:38.670 --> 05:14:45.529
Monal Kumar: Because if you are not able to create for the… yes, if you're not able to create for the very basic part, then that is the…

2604
05:14:45.680 --> 05:14:48.159
Monal Kumar: complex one, right? Yeah.

2605
05:14:48.550 --> 05:14:49.300
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2606
05:14:49.300 --> 05:14:49.720
sandeep shukla: Sure.

2607
05:14:49.720 --> 05:14:51.050
Monal Kumar: So do something, yes.

2608
05:14:51.450 --> 05:14:52.200
sandeep shukla: Thanks, Mom.

2609
05:14:52.200 --> 05:14:53.120
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure.

2610
05:14:53.850 --> 05:15:00.450
Monal Kumar: So… Give me a second, guys. Kanav, your next…

2611
05:15:01.180 --> 05:15:08.370
Kanav: Yeah, hi Munal. So, good afternoon. So, I have around 3 plus years of experience in DevOps.

2612
05:15:08.370 --> 05:15:24.829
Kanav: So, the… I need some guidance from your side. So, basically, what I'm… right now, what I'm trying to think, like, I don't want to isolate myself in, you know, DevOps sites, so I just want to, you know, create models and deploy as well. So, I have, like,

2613
05:15:24.890 --> 05:15:33.020
Kanav: as my background is from DevOps side, so, like, I just want to, you know, become a complete engineer, so…

2614
05:15:33.270 --> 05:15:39.179
Kanav: I just need your guidance. Rather, I have to move for MLOps, or LNOps, or, like…

2615
05:15:39.460 --> 05:15:45.500
Monal Kumar: MLOps is the… is… should be your goal, MLOps or LLM Ops. LLM Ops is nothing but,

2616
05:15:45.860 --> 05:15:55.760
Monal Kumar: part of MLOps, okay? So you can go… your target should be to MLOps or LLMOps, both are kind of the same, suppose, okay? For an example, high level.

2617
05:15:55.950 --> 05:16:00.080
Monal Kumar: And, but to achieve… to go to…

2618
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:05.629
Monal Kumar: MLOps, you need to learn what exactly… what are the steps happening in machine learning, right? Yeah.

2619
05:16:05.740 --> 05:16:10.040
Monal Kumar: So… yes, target the MLOps for LLMOs, that should be your goal.

2620
05:16:10.250 --> 05:16:16.579
Kanav: So, like, my exact goal is, like, I want to become, you know, a complete engineer, so who knows who thinks.

2621
05:16:16.580 --> 05:16:19.079
Monal Kumar: Evil Ops is a computer engineer, yes.

2622
05:16:19.300 --> 05:16:27.839
Kanav: Okay, so, like, my background is, like, from Devo, so I haven't created any, you know, developed any model yet, so that's why I joined this course.

2623
05:16:27.840 --> 05:16:38.570
Monal Kumar: No, you will be able to create model. Once you do that, then use your DevOps skills and try to implement and… right now, I know, practicing things on a scale is not possible, it keeps you charge, right?

2624
05:16:38.570 --> 05:16:38.890
Kanav: You know.

2625
05:16:38.890 --> 05:16:58.450
Monal Kumar: So, once the machine learning is done, and, yeah, once the deep learning is done, from the deep learning, we will create bigger models. How do we scale those models on the DevOps part, and how do we process data? Then, that will give you a bigger picture on this whole MLOps, alright?

2626
05:16:58.780 --> 05:17:10.570
Kanav: Okay, so, like, my one more question. So, like, along with this course, like, what things I should focus on, like, you know, side-by-side things along with this course.

2627
05:17:10.570 --> 05:17:19.799
Monal Kumar: If you're able to deploy machine learning things, deep learning things, you'll be able to deploy generative AI things easily. Generative BI is already deployed, okay?

2628
05:17:19.800 --> 05:17:20.190
Kanav: Anchor.

2629
05:17:20.190 --> 05:17:28.290
Monal Kumar: We rarely deploy our own model in our system, because if you see ChatGPT models are not available for deployment, you cannot download the bids.

2630
05:17:28.290 --> 05:17:30.949
Kanav: Alright, so those are already a part of the API.

2631
05:17:30.950 --> 05:17:42.960
Monal Kumar: Right? There will be some LLM ops with… LLM, which you need to be… which you need to be surrounded by the ops, part of it, alright? But if you are able to do it in the deep learning, you will be able to do it in the LLMs also.

2632
05:17:43.320 --> 05:17:43.960
Kanav: Nope.

2633
05:17:44.250 --> 05:17:50.449
Monal Kumar: not… not a very different steps. Because your target is MLOps, I will not suggest you to go for agentic and other things. Not now.

2634
05:17:50.970 --> 05:17:51.690
Kanav: Okay.

2635
05:17:51.850 --> 05:17:52.450
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2636
05:17:54.750 --> 05:17:55.600
Kanav: Thank you.

2637
05:17:56.770 --> 05:18:06.440
Monal Kumar: So, Guys, if your query is already answered in some way, please unraise your hand, alright?

2638
05:18:06.730 --> 05:18:09.580
Monal Kumar: We still have 26 people, I will answer.

2639
05:18:10.080 --> 05:18:10.970
Monal Kumar: Everyone?

2640
05:18:12.290 --> 05:18:16.229
Monal Kumar: That, again, kind of the same question I'm able to see.

2641
05:18:16.410 --> 05:18:18.430
Monal Kumar: Same pattern. All right.

2642
05:18:18.540 --> 05:18:21.690
Monal Kumar: Next is… Shaky?

2643
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:23.500
Monal Kumar: Saqib?

2644
05:18:23.500 --> 05:18:24.380
SHAQUIB: Yes, sir.

2645
05:18:24.720 --> 05:18:26.290
Monal Kumar: Hi, hello. Yes?

2646
05:18:26.290 --> 05:18:37.800
SHAQUIB: Hello, sir. Thanks for… thanks for staying so long. And my query was, sir, I have done MC, and after that, I have worked for a few… 6 months, like, as a Python developer.

2647
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:42.750
SHAQUIB: But I had to leave that job in 2022 due to some serious health problems.

2648
05:18:43.040 --> 05:18:43.710
SHAQUIB: No.

2649
05:18:43.710 --> 05:18:44.879
Monal Kumar: You're doing well now?

2650
05:18:45.550 --> 05:18:52.599
SHAQUIB: I'm getting better, and I'm trying to get back on track now, and I have 4 years of gap in my resume.

2651
05:18:52.740 --> 05:18:56.659
SHAQUIB: But I want to break into this field, so that's why I wanted to ask William.

2652
05:18:56.660 --> 05:19:00.949
Monal Kumar: If you have a health issue, then it will not be a break. Everyone understands, ma'am.

2653
05:19:01.100 --> 05:19:06.020
Monal Kumar: Okay? Everyone understand that you, have not created this gap.

2654
05:19:06.200 --> 05:19:08.150
Monal Kumar: It has been created for you.

2655
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:14.599
Monal Kumar: So, that's not an issue, but if you have a skill gap, that's what you need to cover.

2656
05:19:15.010 --> 05:19:16.740
SHAQUIB: Yeah, that's why I've joined this course.

2657
05:19:16.740 --> 05:19:18.299
Monal Kumar: That's great, that's great, Shiki.

2658
05:19:18.860 --> 05:19:22.890
SHAQUIB: Okay, sir. And one more thing I wanted to ask was…

2659
05:19:23.050 --> 05:19:31.880
SHAQUIB: will there be… after attending this course, will be able to attend, compete on the Kegel platform?

2660
05:19:32.300 --> 05:19:33.400
Monal Kumar: Yes, you can.

2661
05:19:33.610 --> 05:19:37.849
Monal Kumar: You have chat CPT, even without completing this course, you cannot set up a problem statement.

2662
05:19:38.000 --> 05:19:53.160
Monal Kumar: give it… give some other notebook and ask it to solve it, solve it, solve it, solve it. But to do that also, what exactly it is doing and not doing, you need to learn the basics of machine learning and other things, yes? Machine learning, deep learning. So whether AI is doing right or not.

2663
05:19:53.230 --> 05:19:58.920
Monal Kumar: For that to… for you to learn that, whether it is right or wrong, you need to cover the basics, alright?

2664
05:19:59.080 --> 05:20:00.270
SHAQUIB: Okay, thanks, sir.

2665
05:20:00.500 --> 05:20:01.910
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, you're okay.

2666
05:20:02.910 --> 05:20:10.199
Monal Kumar: Alright, next is… Happy Indian. Hey, Happy Indian.

2667
05:20:13.610 --> 05:20:14.659
Monal Kumar: Under the ad.

2668
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:20.740
Monal Kumar: Right? Devakar is next. Divakar?

2669
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:24.139
Happy Indian: Hey, hi Monu, am I open?

2670
05:20:24.410 --> 05:20:25.450
Monal Kumar: Yes, you're audible.

2671
05:20:25.880 --> 05:20:39.410
Happy Indian: Hey, Monal, so, just a background of mine. So, I'm having overall 16 years of experience, and I moved from system engineer to solution architect, and then to a technical program manager, and now I am in a leadership role.

2672
05:20:39.410 --> 05:20:40.090
Monal Kumar: I'm.

2673
05:20:40.360 --> 05:20:43.460
Happy Indian: So, just a, query over here,

2674
05:20:43.460 --> 05:21:07.530
Happy Indian: mostly, presently, the Gen AI and the Agentic AI is something which is being used for creating the efficiency and to automate most of the things, right? I understand that we will be definitely going through the complete Python part of it and going to build our base strong, but is the VIP coding or the VIP coding tool integration will be also included over here? Because I think this is

2675
05:21:07.530 --> 05:21:11.559
Happy Indian: now becoming a parallel thing, right? Anybody who knows coding.

2676
05:21:11.680 --> 05:21:17.300
Happy Indian: Also, using the bypoding to make the things more efficient and get the things done quickly, right?

2677
05:21:17.300 --> 05:21:23.409
Monal Kumar: VIP coding is something that we are using LLM to solve the problem. Only LLMs. That is the main definition of vibe coding.

2678
05:21:23.550 --> 05:21:37.519
Monal Kumar: Okay, we are getting the answer, if we are getting the error, we are also pasting the error to the error line, getting things again and again until we get the solution. That is what we call as wipe coding. So what we will be doing here, I will not personally teaching you wipe coding because

2679
05:21:37.520 --> 05:21:44.710
Monal Kumar: You guys, if I give you an assignment, you guys can paste, complete the assignment, and provide the solution. That is a white coding.

2680
05:21:44.920 --> 05:21:54.899
Monal Kumar: Are you clear? But if I teach you a VIP coding… what is teaching VIP coding? I can show you some of the examples, but it is not something advanced. It is very simple.

2681
05:21:55.790 --> 05:21:56.520
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2682
05:21:56.520 --> 05:22:05.919
Happy Indian: How to integrate the tool, like, how to integrate the cursor, wind surf, or Replit, and how to do the coding. I think now that integration is also available over the VS Code.

2683
05:22:05.920 --> 05:22:19.470
Monal Kumar: yeah, that is just an extension that we need to do. It is just an installation. Anyone knows how to… I will teach you the basic things, how to install other things. Yes, for sure, I will show you that, what to use, but personally, what I… I really…

2684
05:22:19.470 --> 05:22:26.529
Monal Kumar: do the cop… I really like the copy and paste from the chat. Some people like the agent in the VS Code itself.

2685
05:22:26.560 --> 05:22:32.189
Monal Kumar: And some people like me like, writing on the Chrome and then getting the answer here.

2686
05:22:32.240 --> 05:22:34.610
Monal Kumar: So, it totally depends, we'll show you both the methods.

2687
05:22:35.090 --> 05:22:35.910
Monal Kumar: Yes?

2688
05:22:36.320 --> 05:22:49.610
Happy Indian: Okay, okay, sure. And, one more thing, when we are kind of, going to cover the projects, is there any count, like, how many projects we're going to target, is there going to be a capstone?

2689
05:22:49.640 --> 05:23:07.330
Monal Kumar: It's not count-seek. Personally, before started teaching, I was learning from Capstone. And trust me when I say this, Capstone projects and all the places are very bad. There are just two, three, one, two scripts, and that is capstone.

2690
05:23:07.460 --> 05:23:24.589
Monal Kumar: For me, when I say a project, it means it should have modular, it should have reasoning, it should have… it should show that you're thinking about a problem statement and solving. That's what I'm going to give you, alright? So even if you have four projects, that 4 projects should be sufficiently sufficient to teach you how to deal with problem statement.

2691
05:23:25.330 --> 05:23:29.280
Monal Kumar: Alright? So you will not face any quality issue anywhere.

2692
05:23:29.410 --> 05:23:30.240
Monal Kumar: Alright.

2693
05:23:30.630 --> 05:23:38.129
Happy Indian: Got it. One final thing, whenever you said that we're going to maybe covering only 4 of the projects, or.

2694
05:23:38.130 --> 05:23:44.050
Monal Kumar: That's a hypothetical number, I understand that. Yes, yes. But it will cover all the concepts and everything. Yes, yes, yes.

2695
05:23:44.050 --> 05:23:48.290
Happy Indian: Yeah, so is it going to be a prod-deployable project where.

2696
05:23:48.290 --> 05:23:49.010
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2697
05:23:49.010 --> 05:23:49.770
Happy Indian: So, what is the CRA.

2698
05:23:49.770 --> 05:23:50.479
Monal Kumar: to be played through.

2699
05:23:50.480 --> 05:23:51.000
Happy Indian: planes.

2700
05:23:51.000 --> 05:23:52.329
Monal Kumar: Yes, some of the projects…

2701
05:23:52.330 --> 05:23:54.199
Happy Indian: offs part, yeah, sorry.

2702
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:58.410
Monal Kumar: No, no, that's totally fine. I was also speaking while you were speaking, right? Sorry about that.

2703
05:23:58.440 --> 05:24:10.759
Monal Kumar: If you check the projects part at the end of this course, you will see Project AI data end-to-end. You will see the last project, on page number 32, that is, RAG a QA system with CI-CD integration.

2704
05:24:10.760 --> 05:24:22.700
Monal Kumar: That is CICD, alright? If you check page number 31, where we are talking about deployment and automation, there we are talking about AWS EC2. Some of them will be in parts, some of them will be a project where we have CICD.

2705
05:24:22.900 --> 05:24:41.349
Monal Kumar: Alright? So not every project, because if you're not ready, if I… in the machine learning part, if someone does not know CI-CD, and I teach CI-CD, that person is not going to understand anything, right? So, we are going to introduce this advanced topic as we move forward on the concept part as well.

2706
05:24:41.600 --> 05:24:42.460
Monal Kumar: All right.

2707
05:24:42.720 --> 05:24:45.230
Monal Kumar: Same thing applies to all the projects, yes.

2708
05:24:45.650 --> 05:24:50.570
Happy Indian: Sure, sure. Thank you, thank you, Mona. That's covered my queries, yeah. Thank you.

2709
05:24:50.570 --> 05:24:51.120
Monal Kumar: Thank you.

2710
05:24:51.620 --> 05:24:54.970
Diwakar: Hi, Monu, Devakar here. Hey, Devakar. Yes, yes, I can hear you

2711
05:24:55.960 --> 05:25:10.060
Diwakar: Yeah, so I'll make it quick, actually. So, I had a motorcycle accident here, I took a medical leave for more than a year, and I was doing as a performance engineer before, so my wife is a data engineer, she was the one who started,

2712
05:25:10.200 --> 05:25:21.419
Diwakar: Christian, your training thing. So, I went into training, and it was looking good. So, is the transition from a performance engineer to, AI or ML engineer is practical?

2713
05:25:21.520 --> 05:25:39.060
Diwakar: If so, yeah, if I'm having 16 years of experience, right? So, what can I put for the past 16 years? As you told, it can be a data engineer all these years, and then into AI ML engineer, or should I keep, like, a data scientist or AI architect?

2714
05:25:39.210 --> 05:25:40.760
Diwakar: What… See.

2715
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:45.050
Monal Kumar: Exactly, it depends on what you are targeting.

2716
05:25:45.160 --> 05:26:00.140
Monal Kumar: I will suggest you to do some kind of a homework, based on your current skill set and experience, that what kind of a job role… when I say job role, I'm not just saying AI engineer, I'm also saying in terms of position. Position in terms of associate, engineer, senior engineer, that is also position, right?

2717
05:26:00.180 --> 05:26:11.269
Monal Kumar: So, think of a job role plus the position where you want to head, ping me in the LinkedIn with your resume, and let me check what we can do there, and we will… we will keep on building in that direction.

2718
05:26:11.620 --> 05:26:12.400
Monal Kumar: All right.

2719
05:26:12.910 --> 05:26:17.629
Monal Kumar: That is the best way. Without analyzing, going in the direction is not a good thing.

2720
05:26:17.920 --> 05:26:18.530
Monal Kumar: question, I don'.

2721
05:26:18.530 --> 05:26:38.449
Diwakar: Okay, I'll be LinkedIn then. And, I was going through the GitHub, the page there. It was 3 path, right? So, I'm… we are going for the traditional route, it was for 1 year. But if you see that the duration they mentioned is 4 months for the path 1, and 2 months for the path 2, and 3 months for the path 3, right?

2722
05:26:38.450 --> 05:26:44.449
Monal Kumar: That is not our course. That is like, that is something if you want to do fast track, yes.

2723
05:26:44.450 --> 05:26:49.200
Diwakar: Here, it's like, whatever I am teaching, whatever we are teaching here, if you check the syllabus.

2724
05:26:49.450 --> 05:26:51.270
Monal Kumar: Everything is in very detail.

2725
05:26:51.320 --> 05:27:04.410
Monal Kumar: But in their path in the GitHub, if you check, it is data science first. Data science can be in very high level, can be in very depth. Same goes for DS Machine Learning, CV, NLP. It is any one of them, you can see DS slash MN.

2726
05:27:04.410 --> 05:27:15.940
Monal Kumar: We're not talking about a single thing, we're talking about just things on a high-level overview. So, high-level overview, complete in 4 months, 5 months, but if you want to go and understand the real algorithm, then it will take time.

2727
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:20.890
Diwakar: So, what is your session for me, considering my transition from.

2728
05:27:20.890 --> 05:27:37.470
Monal Kumar: Go with… go with tradition, but always work for parallel things, because right now, agentic and RAG are also there, which does not require a lot of prerequisites. It is very simple, right? So go to ChatGPT, tell that I want to learn this generative, and suggest me some videos.

2729
05:27:37.470 --> 05:27:45.309
Monal Kumar: Then check any videos on YouTube, start at least gain. I'm not saying to go in depth, but at least have an understanding at the very first level, what is an ATVI?

2730
05:27:45.360 --> 05:27:57.780
Monal Kumar: What is agent care? What is RAM? Then see a very simple framework which will enable you to communicate with LLM, like a line chain. Check the first coding, communicate with ChatGPT, that's how you're going to just

2731
05:27:58.790 --> 05:28:10.190
Monal Kumar: 30, 40 lines of code each day, or something. Maybe 2 times a week, you can also practice that, so you're also building something in parallel. A new thing, yes?

2732
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:14.919
Diwakar: Actually, to this traditional route, should I go for the modern route or the advanced route?

2733
05:28:15.080 --> 05:28:29.479
Monal Kumar: traditional, complete the whole traditional route, but I'm not saying to go to the modern.modern route, it is generative AI master, and I don't want you to master. What I want you to do, just have a taste of this generative AI, at least. Then we will again discuss on this one.

2734
05:28:30.080 --> 05:28:30.990
Monal Kumar: For wrong.

2735
05:28:31.640 --> 05:28:34.399
Monal Kumar: I'm not saying to directly go to the modern route, yes?

2736
05:28:35.040 --> 05:28:36.150
Diwakar: Okay, I'll go the traditional…

2737
05:28:36.150 --> 05:28:39.220
Monal Kumar: Yes, do some homework on the modern by yourself.

2738
05:28:39.380 --> 05:28:43.310
Monal Kumar: build how to communicate with ChatGPT using my Python.

2739
05:28:43.660 --> 05:28:55.130
Monal Kumar: Alright? So, do this, then keep on increasing complexity on that modern path, not the modern path present here, because that is a serious modern path. I don't want it to be serious on the parallel path.

2740
05:28:55.590 --> 05:28:57.630
Monal Kumar: At least not in luck, alright?

2741
05:28:58.450 --> 05:29:01.190
Diwakar: Okay, I'll ping and, ping again. Thank you so much.

2742
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:02.320
Monal Kumar: Yes, yeah, thank you.

2743
05:29:03.380 --> 05:29:07.650
Monal Kumar: Alright, then we have Vicky Patnaik.

2744
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:11.869
Vicky Pattnaik: Hi, Monod, good afternoon.

2745
05:29:11.870 --> 05:29:12.980
Monal Kumar: Hey, Vicki, good afternoon.

2746
05:29:12.980 --> 05:29:13.860
Vicky Pattnaik: Can you hear me?

2747
05:29:14.170 --> 05:29:14.789
Monal Kumar: I can hear you.

2748
05:29:14.790 --> 05:29:26.239
Vicky Pattnaik: Okay, thank you so much for patiently hearing and answering all the questions, Mundel. So, most of my doubts, whatever I have, has been cleared, just I'll quickly put my two queries.

2749
05:29:26.300 --> 05:29:44.310
Vicky Pattnaik: So, basically, I'm currently, I have 13 years of experience in working in data management, data governance area, and I also use Java there, right? So, in my current company, there is so much work happening on developing agent AI and all for agile.

2750
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:45.850
Monal Kumar: Everyone is doing that, yeah.

2751
05:29:45.850 --> 05:29:49.899
Vicky Pattnaik: Yeah, right? So, what I was wondering is.

2752
05:29:50.240 --> 05:30:01.429
Vicky Pattnaik: I'm facing a little bit of difficulty in identifying whether data science scientist is a different path than Gen AI, which is a different path, and which one I should opt for.

2753
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:06.450
Monal Kumar: got this good course. Here, we have everything. Data scientist, MR Engineering, agent, engineer.

2754
05:30:07.640 --> 05:30:16.569
Vicky Pattnaik: Correct. So, it is okay to move to any of this path, right? Because I'm currently working in the data area, so I can move into the AI path also.

2755
05:30:16.570 --> 05:30:17.980
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

2756
05:30:18.520 --> 05:30:25.330
Monal Kumar: It's pretty easy, and you are in the correct path, because here you will understand what each of these roles means.

2757
05:30:26.250 --> 05:30:39.220
Vicky Pattnaik: Oh, yeah. And one last question, maybe. So, here we already discussed Gen AI agent AI projects will develop, those won't be full-fledged projects, right?

2758
05:30:39.700 --> 05:30:40.560
Monal Kumar: Yes.

2759
05:30:41.010 --> 05:30:46.039
Monal Kumar: Whole frail project, but not all. We will increment that. For machine learning, we will not have all the CI-CD.

2760
05:30:46.320 --> 05:31:01.919
Monal Kumar: Then, for deep learning, we will introduce something. Then, for generative and RAG, we will introduce CI-CD. So, all levels, because CI-CD is something that can be constant in all the levels, but if I introduce CI-CD at the very start, where we have not even understood what is CI-CD and other things.

2761
05:31:02.660 --> 05:31:05.799
Monal Kumar: that does not create a good experience. So we will learn things on the go.

2762
05:31:06.090 --> 05:31:17.269
Vicky Pattnaik: Sure, sure, sure. One last one, quickly. So for latest trend in AI, what's going on, what new language, what new models are coming, what will be the best, source to.

2763
05:31:17.270 --> 05:31:32.850
Monal Kumar: The best source is YouTube, because if you follow creators, whenever a new model comes, a new video will be uploaded by them as well. Krisha, you can also follow Sunny Savita, okay, for Generative AI, and just follow people, you will see a lot of those posts, alright?

2764
05:31:32.850 --> 05:31:34.640
Vicky Pattnaik: Awesome, sure. Thank you so much, Monu.

2765
05:31:34.640 --> 05:31:36.369
Monal Kumar: Sure, Vicki. Yeah, thanks.

2766
05:31:38.720 --> 05:31:44.779
Monal Kumar: Right? And then we have Anshul, and then we have Siddhar, Past Anshul, then Siddhar.

2767
05:31:51.390 --> 05:31:52.619
Anshul: Yeah, can you hear me?

2768
05:31:52.980 --> 05:31:54.249
Monal Kumar: Yes, I'm sure, I can hear you.

2769
05:31:55.230 --> 05:32:00.139
Anshul: Great, great, thank you. Thank you, thank you, Manil. Thank you, Krish.

2770
05:32:00.780 --> 05:32:02.690
Anshul: And I think… Oh…

2771
05:32:02.830 --> 05:32:07.420
Anshul: You've connected for so long now, right? And there's a lot of… there's a lot to learn from…

2772
05:32:07.880 --> 05:32:10.290
Anshul: How you were patiently listening and answering.

2773
05:32:10.290 --> 05:32:10.660
Monal Kumar: question.

2774
05:32:10.660 --> 05:32:12.190
Anshul: Right?

2775
05:32:12.190 --> 05:32:13.710
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

2776
05:32:13.710 --> 05:32:20.520
Anshul: Great, thank you. I think, I think, I think a lot of us in this session are experienced guys, okay?

2777
05:32:20.700 --> 05:32:22.160
Anshul: And a lot of questions are already…

2778
05:32:22.160 --> 05:32:29.339
Monal Kumar: I can also see that, yeah, this is the first… I'm also getting introduced to everyone here, right? So this is also an introduction, yep.

2779
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:46.889
Anshul: Right, right. And a lot of questions are already answered, so probably, let's see if I can make a little bit of difference here by asking my question. I have 15 years of experience, and I come from an ERP background, okay? You must have heard about SAP, Oracle, and all this stuff, okay?

2780
05:32:47.060 --> 05:32:51.870
Anshul: So we are the guys who are actually… so I'm not a… I'm not a technical guy, I'm kind of a techno-functional guy, you know.

2781
05:32:51.870 --> 05:32:52.500
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

2782
05:32:52.500 --> 05:33:05.270
Anshul: Always sitting with client customers, configuring their systems based on their requirements. So we are actually the data collectors of any organization, be it purchase data, sales data, finance, accounting, production planning, ventricling, everything, you know?

2783
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:09.560
Monal Kumar: So we are kind of a data pipeline, which is part of data engineering, right?

2784
05:33:09.910 --> 05:33:24.939
Anshul: Now, my… I'll just come to the question precisely and don't waste further time. I understand the approaches and everything, you know. So, I am a big believer of following the traditional approach, which we have been discussing, which is probably

2785
05:33:24.960 --> 05:33:33.859
Anshul: you know, bottoms-up approach. You start from data science, and then you go still the, gen AI, agent care, and all that stuff, and then I understand the…

2786
05:33:33.940 --> 05:33:47.609
Anshul: top-down approach, which is Gen AI, then agentic AI, then all that stuff, right? Now, my specific question to you, Monil, is… and I want to pursue, actually, both these things in parallel, because, I have a lot of data with me.

2787
05:33:47.710 --> 05:33:50.990
Anshul: Which I can work on, on my ongoing projects, okay?

2788
05:33:51.640 --> 05:34:03.680
Anshul: And there's a lot of, there's a lot of, you know, as you said, I mean, everybody's doing agent KI, and it's true, because since 6 months before, I never thought that I'm going to sit and learn

2789
05:34:03.820 --> 05:34:07.920
Anshul: ML, okay, never, because I'm into a different field altogether.

2790
05:34:07.920 --> 05:34:09.200
Monal Kumar: Yes, Brendan? Yes, yes, yes.

2791
05:34:09.200 --> 05:34:14.350
Anshul: But then I'm completely into this from last few months. My specific question is,

2792
05:34:14.870 --> 05:34:32.149
Anshul: Is there a perfect handshake between ML and Gen AI, agentic AI, or does it differ from, let's say, case-to-case basis? If I hop onto, let's say, alerting Gen AI, agentic AI, along with this traditional approach.

2793
05:34:32.360 --> 05:34:43.439
Anshul: will I face any problem issues to start with? Is there a perfect way to start with a parallel approach that you can say, okay, I'm sure you can start from this point? Yeah, yeah, I'm just looking for that.

2794
05:34:43.740 --> 05:34:44.860
Monal Kumar: Hmm, okay.

2795
05:34:45.070 --> 05:34:55.580
Monal Kumar: So, what I will suggest to you… there is a parallel pay, but for you, it should not be parallel. It should be sequential at start, then parallel. I will tell you why.

2796
05:34:55.730 --> 05:35:03.680
Monal Kumar: that because you are from techno-functional, that means that you do know technologies, but from the…

2797
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:10.039
Monal Kumar: UI point of view, that functionalities are provided, parameters point of view, setting up systems, and other things, right?

2798
05:35:10.040 --> 05:35:10.869
Anshul: True, true, true.

2799
05:35:10.870 --> 05:35:29.359
Monal Kumar: Yes. So, you don't know what, you do know on a high level that problem and solution, but that solution, how to build, is something that you need to learn. And how you will learn that? By having a very good understanding of the programming language. And the programming language which we are going to use here is that Python.

2800
05:35:29.480 --> 05:35:36.290
Monal Kumar: All right? Okay. So, until and unless you don't understand Python, it will be very hard to even start a parallel thing.

2801
05:35:36.570 --> 05:35:37.799
Monal Kumar: Are they clear?

2802
05:35:37.900 --> 05:35:42.449
Monal Kumar: Second thing is, you should focus on a… once you understand Python.

2803
05:35:43.520 --> 05:35:50.680
Monal Kumar: try to interact with any cloud database that is free tire with your Python, alright? That is your second step.

2804
05:35:51.390 --> 05:36:10.620
Monal Kumar: Alright? I'm giving you this course, and I'm giving you this parallel path, which you should follow. This is… I'm talking about a parallel path, because this course is already in sequential, right? So Python, which we are already a part of the course, database, try to interact with the database, at least just for a few things, and do some basic operations on that. Once you cover that, learn API.

2805
05:36:11.920 --> 05:36:25.470
Monal Kumar: Alright, once you understand FastAPI, then the next thing which you should do is directly, because now you know API, try to use those API to communicate with Google Gemini, to communicate with ChatGPT. Is this part clear?

2806
05:36:25.970 --> 05:36:31.079
Monal Kumar: Python, database, API, and then communicate with LLMs via API.

2807
05:36:31.520 --> 05:36:34.490
Monal Kumar: Okay. Alright, this is the parallel path. This is the parallel path.

2808
05:36:34.580 --> 05:36:37.519
Anshul: Once you know that, then what I want you to do is.

2809
05:36:37.520 --> 05:36:55.339
Monal Kumar: I want you to go to the prompt engineering, because you know Python, I will tell you how to… later, I will tell you how to bridge that Python with the prompt engineering, okay? So, learn a little bit of prompt engineering, which might take you 1, 2 days, or three days, that's all, not more than that.

2810
05:36:55.360 --> 05:37:04.119
Monal Kumar: Once you know the prompt engineering, create workflows with the Python itself. Is this part clear? Are you writing it, or you can watch the recording later, okay?

2811
05:37:04.370 --> 05:37:08.560
Anshul: Yeah, I'm scribbling it, yeah. Okay, so.

2812
05:37:08.560 --> 05:37:15.989
Monal Kumar: create workflows using Python using LLMs, all manually. Once that part is clear, learn LangChain.

2813
05:37:16.520 --> 05:37:25.889
Monal Kumar: And then you can start the… from the… from… you are going to start lending, you are already in the generative AI part of it. Then you can start the parallel and create the projects.

2814
05:37:26.410 --> 05:37:36.229
Monal Kumar: Langchain, Agent TK. That is a parallel path I am suggesting. I'm not suggesting you to go into the NLP, because this part you cannot… you can skip even without knowing NLP.

2815
05:37:37.770 --> 05:37:46.480
Anshul: Okay, great, great, understood, understood. So, I think for some time, I learned about Python and the APIs and databases, you know, a little bit of that, and then probably…

2816
05:37:46.590 --> 05:37:51.309
Anshul: Yes. I can hop onto, Langchin and all, agent decay frameworks, yeah.

2817
05:37:51.310 --> 05:37:52.650
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, true.

2818
05:37:52.970 --> 05:37:54.570
Anshul: Great, great, thank you very much, thank you.

2819
05:37:54.570 --> 05:37:55.629
Monal Kumar: Central, yeah.

2820
05:37:57.060 --> 05:37:57.940
Siddharth: I'm on a loop.

2821
05:37:57.940 --> 05:38:02.500
Monal Kumar: Hello? Oh, okay, sorry, something happened.

2822
05:38:03.070 --> 05:38:05.450
Monal Kumar: Can you please raise your hand again?

2823
05:38:11.580 --> 05:38:13.249
Monal Kumar: What was it, I preferred?

2824
05:38:15.320 --> 05:38:18.699
Monal Kumar: Guys, who was just speaking, can you please write in the chat?

2825
05:38:19.130 --> 05:38:20.979
Monal Kumar: Who was just not speaking?

2826
05:38:23.150 --> 05:38:27.200
Monal Kumar: My mistake, I closed, siddharth, yes.

2827
05:38:27.340 --> 05:38:29.380
Monal Kumar: Yeah, hey Siddharth, sorry about that.

2828
05:38:30.880 --> 05:38:33.060
Siddharth: No worries, Monal. Am I audible?

2829
05:38:33.240 --> 05:38:34.179
Monal Kumar: That's your article.

2830
05:38:34.350 --> 05:38:38.950
Siddharth: Yeah, first of all, thank you for being so patient, and good afternoon to you and the entire team.

2831
05:38:39.960 --> 05:38:44.169
Siddharth: I have a, series of questions, two, three, probably.

2832
05:38:44.360 --> 05:39:01.150
Siddharth: And I'm not sure if they are very well structured, but I'll still go on. So, a bit of background. I have around 3.5 years of experience, primary in data analytics, catering around visualization, that is, Power BI and SQL.

2833
05:39:01.430 --> 05:39:20.390
Siddharth: So, academically, I do come from a quant background, wherein I did study math, stats, econometrics, but at this point of time, I do not remember it from a standpoint of academic rigor. So my question is, how much academic depth is required to excel in data science and long run?

2834
05:39:20.590 --> 05:39:26.600
Siddharth: Do you suggest to go back to academic route and go through these subjects in pen and paper style?

2835
05:39:26.600 --> 05:39:31.690
Monal Kumar: I will teach you everything. I will teach you everything from this digital pen and paper style. Okay?

2836
05:39:32.000 --> 05:39:32.460
Siddharth: Oh, no.

2837
05:39:32.460 --> 05:39:34.270
Monal Kumar: Until it is required, okay?

2838
05:39:34.470 --> 05:39:52.650
Siddharth: Sure, sure. And my second question is, so I did not come from a computer science background when I started in this technology consulting. So, in my work, initially, I struggled a lot with computer science, part of things, like what is an environment, IDs, and in context… Yeah.

2839
05:39:53.360 --> 05:40:09.290
Siddharth: So, for example, in context of PySpark, what does Py4j really do? Does it convert Python code to Java code? Which is incorrect now, I understand that. But all these nuances, would these bridging gap between computer science guys and,

2840
05:40:09.290 --> 05:40:23.400
Monal Kumar: No, it is not a computer science guy. That is a bridge of, okay. For computer science guy, I will teach you what they… I will tell you what they teach you in computer science. Computer science, they teach us electronics, they teach us,

2841
05:40:24.110 --> 05:40:26.550
Monal Kumar: operating systems. They teach us…

2842
05:40:26.720 --> 05:40:43.929
Monal Kumar: everything that is concept-wise, not in theory. So, don't… don't… this, I already mentioned in my previous batch, that don't try to think that computer science guys has a lot, that there is a lot of space between you and computer science guy. There is not.

2843
05:40:44.010 --> 05:41:01.649
Monal Kumar: They just know a few terms, which they are familiar with. Right now, you're not even familiar with those. Once you're familiar with those, once you understand a little bit of those, I have seen in 4 years of bachelor's also, at the end of the bachelor's, people don't know how to think… how to create logic from the for loop.

2844
05:41:01.970 --> 05:41:09.699
Monal Kumar: So it's not a computer science guy. It is… it totally depends on the person. Maybe you're trying to compete, or you're seeing a person who knows too well.

2845
05:41:09.810 --> 05:41:15.340
Monal Kumar: That is not the case. Computer science guys are not too far from non-computer science guys, okay?

2846
05:41:15.340 --> 05:41:20.179
Siddharth: Probably the people around me might be exceptionally right in that case.

2847
05:41:20.180 --> 05:41:20.640
Monal Kumar: Yeah, okay.

2848
05:41:20.960 --> 05:41:30.329
Monal Kumar: don't compare with on that direction, and trust me, if you check the previous batch recording also, I started from what is a CPU, what is a RAM.

2849
05:41:30.640 --> 05:41:31.460
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2850
05:41:31.460 --> 05:41:32.100
Siddharth: Bye.

2851
05:41:32.100 --> 05:41:32.750
Monal Kumar: I'm also doing…

2852
05:41:32.750 --> 05:41:33.930
Siddharth: That idiot.

2853
05:41:33.930 --> 05:41:42.360
Monal Kumar: Yes, because there are… I do know that people are from non-tech. How am I expecting that they should know all of this GP, CPU, and other things? I will teach everything, okay?

2854
05:41:42.360 --> 05:41:56.380
Siddharth: Alright, alright. One more question. So, this is, for someone else, who might be joining this course, from Wednesday, probably. So, they are from sales background with over 1 year in experience.

2855
05:41:56.380 --> 05:42:08.019
Siddharth: Does it make sense for them to, learn to start this course, and how would their roadmap be? Because they are totally distanced from this, stream.

2856
05:42:08.020 --> 05:42:11.169
Monal Kumar: Only if they are passionate, only if they want that

2857
05:42:11.530 --> 05:42:24.880
Monal Kumar: I, because passion can… I'm not saying that passion should be AI. Passion should be, I want to switch my job. Passion should be, I should do something. If they have that, it means there is no other way

2858
05:42:25.020 --> 05:42:26.740
Monal Kumar: Other than learning.

2859
05:42:26.930 --> 05:42:36.499
Monal Kumar: All they have to do is learn. If they just want to learn AI for the sake of exploring, then they might not end up at the stage, because they don't even know the stage they want to be.

2860
05:42:36.670 --> 05:42:44.479
Siddharth: Are you getting my point? I understood, so I had this interaction. They are pretty much serious about it, but the only question is…

2861
05:42:45.420 --> 05:42:52.530
Siddharth: starting from a sales role, jumping onto data science role, how would that be justifiable? How would the roadmap look like?

2862
05:42:53.280 --> 05:43:04.729
Monal Kumar: No, see, when you are transferring from one domain to another, you convert some of the experience of sales into some of your projects, but what you want at the end is

2863
05:43:04.880 --> 05:43:18.690
Monal Kumar: Because for a salesperson, what they can do, they have created this with a team of technical people, they have created a sales funnel, or they have created some kind of a chatbot, which is giving them a higher conversion, right?

2864
05:43:18.690 --> 05:43:19.070
Siddharth: Totally right.

2865
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:29.889
Monal Kumar: That salesperson has what? That salesperson has a domain… has a domain understanding of the sales. They know the technical term of what actually, business use, right? There are a lot.

2866
05:43:30.210 --> 05:43:43.549
Monal Kumar: terms which overlap between sales and the business people. Business means management also, right? So if you have that understanding, they can speak the language which management speaks, and then have the skills of the AI. But until they get that job.

2867
05:43:43.840 --> 05:43:50.519
Monal Kumar: What they have to do is try to find… try to create a project that also has that sales component.

2868
05:43:50.790 --> 05:43:57.910
Monal Kumar: So, at least in the interview, they can tell that, okay, I've created this, but I've also added my domain knowledge of the sales into this project to make it better.

2869
05:43:58.030 --> 05:43:58.880
Monal Kumar: Yes?

2870
05:43:58.880 --> 05:43:59.220
Siddharth: Understood.

2871
05:43:59.220 --> 05:44:01.570
Monal Kumar: Is it easily possible? Yes, possible or not?

2872
05:44:02.780 --> 05:44:04.920
Siddharth: No, it looks like that. Yeah.

2873
05:44:04.920 --> 05:44:06.220
Monal Kumar: Yeah, it is possible.

2874
05:44:06.700 --> 05:44:07.140
Siddharth: Understood.

2875
05:44:07.140 --> 05:44:12.709
Monal Kumar: Even doctors can convert, their domain knowledge to the AI. Why?

2876
05:44:12.710 --> 05:44:13.739
Siddharth: Yeah, like.

2877
05:44:13.740 --> 05:44:20.219
Monal Kumar: whiteboards, right? Why not do some kind of a screening before coming to the doctor's room, before coming to the doctor's room?

2878
05:44:20.340 --> 05:44:32.339
Monal Kumar: screened via chat GPT, screened via something. So there is always a way to convert now, because AI is not just technical. AI is not a way to communicate with the customers effectively, to just communicate,

2879
05:44:32.700 --> 05:44:34.140
Monal Kumar: What should I say?

2880
05:44:34.460 --> 05:44:37.320
Monal Kumar: Sorry about that, I think that microphone might have sounded.

2881
05:44:37.520 --> 05:44:43.489
Monal Kumar: On behalf of humans, if something… if AI can do a little bit of job on behalf of humans, it means you're a product.

2882
05:44:44.090 --> 05:44:44.860
Monal Kumar: Alright?

2883
05:44:44.860 --> 05:44:45.700
Siddharth: Understood.

2884
05:44:45.850 --> 05:44:46.300
Monal Kumar: Yep.

2885
05:44:46.300 --> 05:44:47.689
Siddharth: Yeah, that answers my question.

2886
05:44:47.690 --> 05:44:48.690
Monal Kumar: Yeah, she answered that.

2887
05:44:48.690 --> 05:44:58.180
Siddharth: Also, I'm sorry for stretching it, one last one. Is there, like, how much is the overlap with the data engineering side? For example.

2888
05:44:58.180 --> 05:44:58.950
Monal Kumar: Okay.

2889
05:44:58.950 --> 05:45:04.899
Siddharth: PySpark, is there any overlap, Databricks and Unity Catalog data governance part as well?

2890
05:45:04.900 --> 05:45:07.080
Monal Kumar: In some jobs it is, I will tell you.

2891
05:45:07.230 --> 05:45:12.589
Monal Kumar: When the job of data engineer ends, Data scientist job starts.

2892
05:45:13.290 --> 05:45:18.920
Siddharth: No, I was actually asking in context of our course, are we going to touch on these topics also?

2893
05:45:18.920 --> 05:45:20.230
Monal Kumar: Nope, nope, nope.

2894
05:45:20.410 --> 05:45:37.460
Monal Kumar: We are not, but very few companies expect machine learning and data scientists to know PySparks and Databricks. It means those companies require machine learning engineers to also pull the data, manage the data, and train the model as well, AI models. But it happens very weirdly.

2895
05:45:37.460 --> 05:45:40.849
Monal Kumar: Okay? So data engineering part we are not going to cover and not going to touch here.

2896
05:45:41.280 --> 05:45:46.230
Siddharth: Inspect that the data engineer gave the data, and then we will start the course. This is what we will do.

2897
05:45:46.330 --> 05:45:46.910
Monal Kumar: All right.

2898
05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:50.120
Siddharth: Got it, got it. Thank you, thanks for answering.

2899
05:45:50.370 --> 05:45:51.090
Monal Kumar: Here's that?

2900
05:45:52.400 --> 05:45:55.100
Monal Kumar: Right, and Vevin, you are next.

2901
05:45:56.540 --> 05:45:57.560
Vevin: Hey, hi, Marilla.

2902
05:45:57.560 --> 05:45:59.070
Monal Kumar: next. Hello. Hey.

2903
05:45:59.400 --> 05:46:00.480
Vevin: Hey, can you hear me?

2904
05:46:00.480 --> 05:46:01.580
Monal Kumar: Yes, I can hear you.

2905
05:46:02.210 --> 05:46:10.729
Vevin: Hey, thank you so much, Munil, for giving me the opportunity. I've been waiting for quite some time, so I just firstly want to thank you for this session.

2906
05:46:10.850 --> 05:46:12.040
Monal Kumar: Thank you very much.

2907
05:46:12.750 --> 05:46:37.190
Vevin: So I just want to give you my background. I've been working in, you know, software testing, like, software developer and test. I've been in this field for, like, 15 years as of now. So, you know, I have experience with Selenium, TestNG, Maven, Jenkins, you know, some DevOps tools, Kubernetes, Docker, so I have, you know, kind of a little bit of experience around that. I've built, like, you know, automation frameworks.

2908
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:50.870
Vevin: using, you know, the Java API automation, rest assured, performance testing. So I have kind of, you know, like, experience with all these things, and I'm kind of right now in a lead role, managing team of, like, six resources.

2909
05:46:50.870 --> 05:46:54.310
Monal Kumar: about to tell that you're good for LV drone, but you're already…

2910
05:46:54.310 --> 05:47:02.259
Vevin: Right, right. But, you know, like, my passion is not, you know, like, leading people. I'm mostly, like, you know, kind of an individual contributor.

2911
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:09.209
Vevin: So… so, you know, like, I think probably the same thing as you, like, you know, like you said, intro… introverted guy, right?

2912
05:47:09.210 --> 05:47:10.240
Monal Kumar: So.

2913
05:47:10.240 --> 05:47:33.630
Vevin: same challenges. But, you know, like, right now, I see, like, you know, in my, company, I'm trying to… I mean, this is, like, a data science team, and I'm planning to, like, switch to that team. And, even, like, you know, in my team, like, you know, in the QA, you know, like, they want that, you know, that we implement something using AI to improve our productivity, you know, with QA processes.

2914
05:47:33.920 --> 05:47:49.760
Vevin: So, you know, like, in the next 6 months, you know, they have this thing that, you know, that we have to build something, you know, to use, leverage AI to improve the processes. So, I just wanted to know, I mean, I have… I kind of, you know, experiment a little bit with MCP also, like, Model Context Protocol.

2915
05:47:49.970 --> 05:47:56.840
Vevin: have, like, some very basic experience with Python, though, you know, Java is my main programming language.

2916
05:47:57.150 --> 05:48:10.360
Vevin: I just wanted to know, like, I mean, like, you know, one of the use cases, what I was thinking of, like, you know, building was, like, you know, converting the story requirements into, like, you know, test cases. You know, like, I could… I mean, we use Azure DevOps, so you don't want to…

2917
05:48:10.360 --> 05:48:11.839
Monal Kumar: Really cool, yes.

2918
05:48:11.840 --> 05:48:17.119
Vevin: Right. But, you know, like, the thing with me is, like, you know, I do not know, like, I mean.

2919
05:48:17.300 --> 05:48:24.059
Vevin: I mean, because, you know, when I kind of, you know, Google around stuff, and even, you know, if I use these chat GPT and all this to, you know, like.

2920
05:48:24.060 --> 05:48:31.190
Vevin: give me some idea, like, how to build it. I mean, there's so much of information that, you know, a lot of things are kind of coming up in the market, and, you know, these

2921
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:44.760
Vevin: new terms like Langchain, Langraph, RAG, you know, like this MCP, HNTKI, I mean, I don't know… I mean, there's no structure, like, I don't know, like, where to start, because, you know, this is my use case, which I want to build.

2922
05:48:44.840 --> 05:49:03.719
Vevin: But I do not know, like, where to start. I mean, I saw this course, but, you know, like, I mean, I understand, you know, the fundamentals are really critical, you know, to have a good understanding of, like, you know, agentic AI, generative AI, but I have, like, some, you know, the next 6 months where I have to build something,

2923
05:49:03.780 --> 05:49:08.859
Vevin: I mean, like, I know, like, you know, this course is going to take, like, one year to, you know, like, go through everything.

2924
05:49:08.860 --> 05:49:10.369
Monal Kumar: Something before this, yeah.

2925
05:49:11.000 --> 05:49:18.549
Vevin: Yeah, so I… I mean, can you just give me some… yeah, like, how do I go there? I mean…

2926
05:49:18.740 --> 05:49:19.350
Monal Kumar: Hmm.

2927
05:49:19.720 --> 05:49:20.339
Vevin: Thank you.

2928
05:49:21.530 --> 05:49:33.789
Monal Kumar: See, first of all, I was also about to tell the same thing at the start, that your tech skills that you have, it sounds like a lead, because you have a lot of skills and you've worked in a lot of things.

2929
05:49:33.790 --> 05:49:41.860
Monal Kumar: But also, it does not feel like a streamlined skills that is used to create something that requires the skills of the same set.

2930
05:49:41.860 --> 05:49:46.750
Monal Kumar: Right? You have skill set from all different kinds of sets, but not Right?

2931
05:49:46.750 --> 05:49:54.390
Vevin: I would say, like, you know, like, for the, you know, like, building QA automation frameworks, like UI automation framework, API automation framework.

2932
05:49:54.390 --> 05:50:11.619
Vevin: that's my core skill, I'm kind of managing the team with, you know, like… because I have kind of built everything from scratch by myself. So, you know, that's my core skill. Besides that, I have knowledge of, you know, like, Docker I've used, Kubernetes I've used, Grafana I've used, you know, for performance monitoring, I'm kind of using Grafana. So, you know, I've kind of…

2933
05:50:11.620 --> 05:50:23.950
Vevin: build that whole stack myself, like, in using Telegraph to, you know, monitor these, you know, like, servers, and, you know, pushing all this data into InfluxDB, and then using Grafana to read all this data from… Yeah, yeah, that is a requirement, yes.

2934
05:50:23.950 --> 05:50:38.979
Vevin: I've done all that by hand from scratch. But, you know, like, right… so, you know, like, but right now… but, you know, my core is, like, you know, software developer and test. That's, like, my core, which I'm kind of, you know, actively doing. But, you know, like, I want to switch to data science.

2935
05:50:38.980 --> 05:50:57.370
Vevin: But, you know, right now, my first step, I see, like, you know, since the team has a request that, you know, I mean, the managers and the management has a request, like, how do you plan to leverage AI to build, you know, something which can improve our productivity? So, you know, like, the first use case, what came to my mind was, like, you know, converting these story requirements into test cases.

2936
05:50:57.890 --> 05:51:05.480
Vevin: But, you know, like, I just wanted to know, like, you know, how can this course help me? I know it's going to take some time till we reach that stage, but I have, like, 6 months.

2937
05:51:05.480 --> 05:51:17.139
Monal Kumar: Yeah, whatever you have, you need to target more in terms of MCP, RAGs, and those chatbots, because if I talk about organization, organization right now.

2938
05:51:17.250 --> 05:51:24.799
Monal Kumar: For any use case they are trying to sell, or they're trying to build something that, management can see, right?

2939
05:51:24.800 --> 05:51:25.410
Vevin: biggest.

2940
05:51:25.550 --> 05:51:28.530
Monal Kumar: And, what you should be targeting is…

2941
05:51:28.790 --> 05:51:32.999
Monal Kumar: as I mentioned, this is the same path I would also suggest to you, that

2942
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:42.169
Monal Kumar: Python, you already know the SQL, you already know the APIs, right? Yeah. So, now that you have covered this place, try to communicate with LLMs using just Python.

2943
05:51:42.440 --> 05:51:44.260
Monal Kumar: Alright? I think just by that.

2944
05:51:44.380 --> 05:51:54.280
Monal Kumar: Using just Python, using LLMs and prompt engineering, create a workflow, so that you will know what LLMs are doing, and how we can create workflow of our own, without using Langchain.

2945
05:51:55.350 --> 05:51:56.050
Vevin: Okay.

2946
05:51:56.110 --> 05:52:01.880
Monal Kumar: So using Python and LLMs, create a workflow just from the prompt engineering, create a structure output.

2947
05:52:02.000 --> 05:52:08.829
Monal Kumar: that output should be passed into the another system, another system, another system, until unless you have satisfied all the things. Is this part clear?

2948
05:52:08.910 --> 05:52:21.680
Monal Kumar: Okay? Now, from this workflow, because, what you can do, let's suppose your, email is vein at red gmail.com, alright? You can connect your LLM call, output of the LLM,

2949
05:52:21.720 --> 05:52:32.100
Monal Kumar: will be passing to the database. Database will be retrieving something. Whatever the output of the database is, let's suppose webin at the gmail.com is not present in the authorized table.

2950
05:52:32.290 --> 05:52:47.940
Monal Kumar: Then what LLM, you can process that information with the LLM and check whether to validate or not. If validate, pass to the next model, otherwise not validate, so all you're doing, what? Without using the Langgraph LangChain framework, you're creating a workflow just from your Python skills.

2951
05:52:48.210 --> 05:53:05.419
Monal Kumar: Once you understand that, what you will do, you will understand that I require more context. I require context all around, then you will add MCP. So, I will want you to work raw coding, and whatever problem statement that you have, try to solve with RAG, then it would use language, then it would use RAG and MCPs.

2952
05:53:05.630 --> 05:53:06.530
Monal Kumar: Are you getting my point?

2953
05:53:06.530 --> 05:53:19.879
Vevin: So I would honestly say, like, you know, I tried this with MCP because, you know, like, because, you know, we use Azure DevOps, right? Yes. So there was, like, you know, I was exploring on GitHub, like, you know, if there is any MCP for, like, you know, connecting to Azure DevOps.

2954
05:53:19.930 --> 05:53:39.060
Vevin: And I found that, you know, there is a MCP, you know, they're built for Azure DevOps, so I used that MCP in VS Code to, you know, like, kind of, you know, give it some template, like, you know, can you create a defect with this, this, this description? And it was able to create the defect. Or, like, you know, can you create a test case and, you know, these are some of the steps. And, you know.

2955
05:53:39.060 --> 05:53:46.139
Vevin: just click enter, and it creates the test case in Azure DevOps. But, you know, it was more like a manual process, though it was done through MCP.

2956
05:53:46.140 --> 05:53:57.979
Vevin: But it was, like, a manual process that, you know, I'm kind of, you know, like, manually, like, you know, telling MCP, like, you know, this is it, create the test case, create this, create that. But I wanted to automate that process of, like, you know.

2957
05:53:57.980 --> 05:54:00.029
Monal Kumar: That you can do with workflow, yes.

2958
05:54:00.450 --> 05:54:00.810
Vevin: Yeah.

2959
05:54:00.810 --> 05:54:10.359
Monal Kumar: So, that's what I'm saying. Ask one LLM to first restructure the prompt, restructure whatever the problem statement that you have, along with the data into a particular format.

2960
05:54:10.460 --> 05:54:20.190
Monal Kumar: ask another LLM that this is a structured one, and generate some output. Another LLM, which is kind of an architect, asked that if you have this particular problem.

2961
05:54:20.200 --> 05:54:33.460
Monal Kumar: which of the things which we require, and create test set for that. Once we have the test set, again, do something on it. So, create multiple workflows to define it. If you create one or two, I think that will not suffice. It will not create that structure that you want.

2962
05:54:33.810 --> 05:54:35.029
Monal Kumar: Are you getting my point?

2963
05:54:35.830 --> 05:54:37.739
Monal Kumar: different level and detail to it.

2964
05:54:38.060 --> 05:54:43.120
Monal Kumar: what MCP is? MCP is kind of just an adapter to multiple places where you have the context, right?

2965
05:54:43.530 --> 05:54:44.020
Vevin: Yes.

2966
05:54:44.020 --> 05:55:00.409
Monal Kumar: It is not a big thing, but MCP will not… MCP will not… MCP alone will not for… LLMs do the main reasoning, MCP just provide the context of… from all the places, right? But if your LLM context prompt engineering and all the workflow is not correct, what MCP is going to do?

2967
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:06.299
Vevin: But MCP has, like, I mean, the LLM built in, right?

2968
05:55:06.820 --> 05:55:10.060
Monal Kumar: Now, LCP does… and in MCP, we provide the LLM.

2969
05:55:10.060 --> 05:55:15.580
Vevin: What is the reasoning for MCP? So, MCP is more like, you know, kind of, let's say, like, you know.

2970
05:55:15.580 --> 05:55:22.959
Monal Kumar: MCP is a Type-C. MCP is like an adapter. Let's suppose from the laptop, okay? You have an adapter. Yes, exactly, right.

2971
05:55:22.960 --> 05:55:25.020
Vevin: It's like APIs are adapted to the database, right?

2972
05:55:25.020 --> 05:55:26.350
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2973
05:55:26.350 --> 05:55:26.740
Vevin: Exactly.

2974
05:55:26.740 --> 05:55:35.380
Monal Kumar: And we provide an element to the MCP so that it has a reasoning also, that went to pick what, based on the description and the parenting model that she applied there.

2975
05:55:36.910 --> 05:55:41.099
Monal Kumar: We ask LLM, okay? We tell LLM that this is all the context.

2976
05:55:41.250 --> 05:55:43.760
Monal Kumar: Choose when to pick what, and other things.

2977
05:55:44.080 --> 05:55:47.500
Monal Kumar: by agenting, yeah. Okay? So, you can work, but at least…

2978
05:55:47.700 --> 05:55:53.250
Monal Kumar: If you try to build something from the ground up, then you will know, why do we want to require MCP? In some cases, you might not even require it.

2979
05:55:53.530 --> 05:55:54.699
Vevin: Okay, okay.

2980
05:55:54.700 --> 05:55:55.990
Monal Kumar: Are you getting my point?

2981
05:55:56.350 --> 05:56:13.369
Monal Kumar: the workflow which you want, and on that workflow, if that workflow requires modularity, then it will start creating your own framework kind of a thing, right? Because you're storing prompts somewhere, storing things somewhere. Then on that one, if you think that now it is becoming large, I want some other method, then try to introduce Langchain.

2982
05:56:13.400 --> 05:56:19.929
Monal Kumar: If Langchain is not working, try to check what are the different methods I need. Whenever you need it, only introduce them.

2983
05:56:20.170 --> 05:56:26.080
Monal Kumar: If you try to unnecessarily introduce things, there are thousands of these concepts in this generative AI part, right?

2984
05:56:26.270 --> 05:56:31.860
Monal Kumar: So, first, bring the concept, then think of a problem. It is not a good way. Problem?

2985
05:56:31.860 --> 05:56:32.490
Vevin: Hmm.

2986
05:56:32.490 --> 05:56:43.270
Monal Kumar: Is solution present in a simple manner? Yes. If not, what are the other methods? Then check which tool I need. Don't go with tool and the solution. Go with what is the solution?

2987
05:56:43.390 --> 05:56:46.690
Monal Kumar: Is there any tool which can help me solve this better? Then do not.

2988
05:56:47.630 --> 05:56:54.829
Vevin: I think, like, you know, the problem, what happens is, like, you know, you know, with this, you know, the AI space and how it is evolving, you know, like.

2989
05:56:55.050 --> 05:56:57.960
Vevin: It's like, you know, more like, I don't know what I don't know.

2990
05:56:58.260 --> 05:57:02.329
Vevin: Yeah. So, you know, that's where, you know, the problem happens, like, when you do not know what you're doing.

2991
05:57:02.330 --> 05:57:03.699
Monal Kumar: I understand, yeah.

2992
05:57:03.700 --> 05:57:17.180
Vevin: So, you know, if I have a problem, and I, okay, yeah, I… you know, you can even accomplish it using just purely Python, but then, you know, okay, you know, you can… if you use this, you know, it would have been more easier to do it. Yes. Right? So, you know.

2993
05:57:17.180 --> 05:57:27.110
Monal Kumar: That's the exact point, that is the point which you need to figure it out. Duels are simple, and if you think that, some other libraries are there, just search on Google, because you know Google AI Mode?

2994
05:57:27.570 --> 05:57:28.300
Vevin: Right.

2995
05:57:28.300 --> 05:57:32.909
Monal Kumar: when we search on Google, there is AI mode there, which search on web crawls, right?

2996
05:57:32.960 --> 05:57:45.330
Monal Kumar: That is… I personally use it often, because it checks from all this Reddit push can check everywhere, right? Same issue everyone is facing right now. It's not just you, right? Because these are thousands of tools.

2997
05:57:45.330 --> 05:57:54.559
Monal Kumar: So, first, try to check it, try to check from those mode, try to check other people, right? And maybe try to be active on the community, because community people, a lot of the people might give you a solution.

2998
05:57:54.620 --> 05:57:58.390
Monal Kumar: Right. Which is very simple, other people are using Langra for that.

2999
05:57:58.640 --> 05:58:00.629
Monal Kumar: It might exist as well, yes?

3000
05:58:00.760 --> 05:58:01.420
Vevin: Right.

3001
05:58:01.590 --> 05:58:02.130
Monal Kumar: Yeah.

3002
05:58:02.570 --> 05:58:03.130
Monal Kumar: Yeah.

3003
05:58:03.130 --> 05:58:08.309
Vevin: So, I just wanted to know one more thing, you know, regarding the traditional route and, you know, the modern route.

3004
05:58:08.810 --> 05:58:16.759
Vevin: Do you think that I should look at the modern route so I can speed up things, or you think that…

3005
05:58:16.760 --> 05:58:20.839
Monal Kumar: to speed up, you require that, but I think,

3006
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:41.969
Monal Kumar: Yes, for your problem statement, you don't require ML right now, but I'm not sure when you will be needing it, alright? That part you can only tell me, yeah. But you already have Python and SQL, because you already need, you already covered the first 6… in the 6 months, you already covered, like, 3-4 months of it. You know SQL, you know database and all.

3007
05:58:42.280 --> 05:58:44.129
Vevin: Yeah, yes, yeah, I know SQL database.

3008
05:58:44.130 --> 05:58:45.180
Monal Kumar: Yeah.

3009
05:58:45.180 --> 05:58:48.410
Vevin: I'm a professional, you know, like, database developer, but I know.

3010
05:58:48.410 --> 05:58:49.230
Monal Kumar: You know how to do.

3011
05:58:49.230 --> 05:58:50.919
Vevin: Join server queries.

3012
05:58:51.030 --> 05:58:52.810
Vevin: Joining tables, I know all that.

3013
05:58:52.810 --> 05:58:58.909
Monal Kumar: I know, because you're a lead, I know you… I know that you can do things, okay? If it requires, you will solve it, yeah.

3014
05:58:59.100 --> 05:58:59.720
Vevin: Right.

3015
05:58:59.720 --> 05:59:12.899
Monal Kumar: Yeah, so do you think that I should, you know, like, look at the modern route, or… Yes, as I told, right, the method which I suggested is to directly go with the workflow using Python and communicate with LLM. I directly told you to directly go there.

3016
05:59:13.170 --> 05:59:13.810
Vevin: Right.

3017
05:59:14.410 --> 05:59:33.219
Monal Kumar: Okay? But in the meantime, if you think that machine learning is something which will help you, then after a few months, or whenever you have time, when you get a mail for machine learning in the community, just check when the machine learning starts starting. I will suggest you to also look at that, because that will open your perspective that, okay, this is how

3018
05:59:33.310 --> 05:59:35.229
Monal Kumar: This is why things are…

3019
05:59:35.880 --> 05:59:42.850
Monal Kumar: the evaluation and other things. Once you understand it, it will, again, answer a lot of things, like, I'm not sure when to use what, kind of thing.

3020
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:55.270
Vevin: Right. And, you know, like, I… I'm more, you know, looking at, you know, I don't want to, like, you know, look at recordings. I would… I prefer, like, you know, when the session is going on and attend it live, because, you know, you have opportunity to ask any doubts.

3021
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:56.080
Monal Kumar: So it's cool.

3022
05:59:56.460 --> 06:00:02.349
Vevin: So, you know, so that's why I'm not into, you know, like, okay, you know, scores will get recorded, and then I'll watch it.

3023
06:00:02.590 --> 06:00:08.879
Monal Kumar: But there is community, right? If you will check what is the current module going on, topic going on, it will be able to help you.

3024
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:14.520
Vevin: Yeah, I mean, of course, you know, we can do that, but it becomes, you know, more asynchronous, so, you know, it's like, okay, you'll ask, then…

3025
06:00:14.520 --> 06:00:15.100
Monal Kumar: Yeah, yeah.

3026
06:00:15.100 --> 06:00:25.700
Vevin: You know, you have to wait for some time. So, you know, like, it's this kind of a delay, right? So, like, right now, when we're talking, I'm just asking you, and, you know, I'm like, once I'm done, it's done.

3027
06:00:25.860 --> 06:00:36.359
Vevin: So, you know, like, with the AI, you know, like, that Gen AI and the, you know, the modern route, is that course going on in parallel right now, or it's already kind of in the middle of…

3028
06:00:36.360 --> 06:00:38.250
Monal Kumar: The 10-year course will be next month.

3029
06:00:38.600 --> 06:00:40.060
Monal Kumar: It will start next month.

3030
06:00:40.780 --> 06:00:41.810
Vevin: Okay, it'll start next month.

3031
06:00:41.810 --> 06:00:50.149
Monal Kumar: That is more on the Gen AI, generative AI part of it, learning LLMs, training LLMs, that is more on that direction. But if you specifically want to drag an agent.

3032
06:00:50.150 --> 06:01:04.789
Monal Kumar: We already have one course that is already running. I think it is the Batch 3 of it. If you want, you can get… you can just connect with the sales team how much duration is left, how much of the classes have already been completed. Just check it, as go to the generative AI part as well.

3033
06:01:04.790 --> 06:01:12.009
Vevin: Because, you know, I don't know, like, you know, if I join that course in the middle, then, you know, like, will I be able to catch up into, like, you know, what has already been covered?

3034
06:01:12.160 --> 06:01:15.170
Vevin: And then if I join the middle, then I may not be able to understand, like…

3035
06:01:15.170 --> 06:01:30.299
Monal Kumar: 3 to 4 months. It is not a very big course, but first check that… first ask that… check the city bus. If you think that if you like it, it's something that you're okay with the recordings as well, or maybe some classes are left, just… just try it out. Just check what is out there, okay?

3036
06:01:30.300 --> 06:01:30.910
Vevin: But…

3037
06:01:30.910 --> 06:01:31.339
Monal Kumar: Top of the same.

3038
06:01:31.340 --> 06:01:42.139
Vevin: The problem statement, like, you know, for the problem statement I described to you, you think, like, you know, is it better to go through that age, you know, like, the RAG thing, or, like, the modern route.

3039
06:01:42.140 --> 06:01:48.820
Monal Kumar: What you require is, you require generative part, you require heirloom reasoning capabilities, right?

3040
06:01:49.180 --> 06:01:49.520
Vevin: Okay.

3041
06:01:49.520 --> 06:01:57.640
Monal Kumar: Because you want test set to be written. Machine learning cannot write test set. Llms who have an understanding of the world can write test set, right?

3042
06:01:57.640 --> 06:01:58.420
Vevin: Right, right.

3043
06:01:58.420 --> 06:02:15.660
Monal Kumar: So, you require LLM, and LLM is a part of the JTVI. And what you want is, you want that test set to be evaluated by another LLM, or maybe you want some structure into it, right? Because at the end, you want those test set to be present somewhere else, not in the chat.

3044
06:02:15.880 --> 06:02:17.410
Vevin: Exactly, exactly.

3045
06:02:17.410 --> 06:02:32.329
Monal Kumar: And when you want the test set to be present somewhere else, then what you want, you want a structure output of the code from the LLM, save into a PY file or a Java file or something. For those, you require multi-scale LLMs in a different place. So maybe you want to create some kind of an API where

3046
06:02:32.330 --> 06:02:43.730
Monal Kumar: once RLM creates, that file, you are going to, maybe create and update files or something, download or update, or maybe send it to a binary via API, whatever is required.

3047
06:02:43.990 --> 06:02:48.069
Vevin: Yeah, right, right. I mean, I have to send it to Azure DevOps, so, you know, like… Yes.

3048
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:51.010
Monal Kumar: Whatever is required, you need to find a way, so…

3049
06:02:51.030 --> 06:03:02.790
Monal Kumar: I'm not saying that langchain or Langgraph is the way, but the way is, prompt engineering, getting structured output from the LEDAM, and creating a workflow. Workflow you create with langchain, workflow you create with novel Python, whatever is required.

3050
06:03:02.790 --> 06:03:11.460
Monal Kumar: So, you need to go in that direction. Not really agentic. Agentic is something that you're asking LLN to decide. Here, you don't want LLN to decide your steps.

3051
06:03:11.480 --> 06:03:16.969
Monal Kumar: You have the steps already predefined, you want those steps to be done by LLM. So.

3052
06:03:16.970 --> 06:03:17.430
Vevin: Great.

3053
06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:29.989
Monal Kumar: you don't require agentic, you require, maybe some test cases, you can also write it in the database or something. Whatever is required, then you require RAG, but for now, in this use case, you don't require RAG as well. You require a workflow.

3054
06:03:31.160 --> 06:03:47.409
Vevin: So I have, like, you know, one more use case, you know, what I want to do is, like, you know, let's say, like, you know, normally what people are doing, even manually right now, you know, they just take the story requirement, they put it in the LLM, and, you know, tell the LLM, you know, chat GPT, can you write, like, you know, test cases for it? And, you know, you know, it will just go…

3055
06:03:47.410 --> 06:03:54.219
Vevin: you know, like, you… once you put the prompt to chat GPT, it'll just, you know, based on whatever requirement you give it from that story, it'll write some test cases.

3056
06:03:54.220 --> 06:04:08.120
Vevin: But, you know, I had this idea in my mind that what I wanted to do is, like, you know, how is it that, you know, possible for, you know, like, let's say a tool like ChatGPT to understand the full context of the application? You know, let's say, like, you know, you have, like, 100 stories, right? I mean, all these stories are in the backlog.

3057
06:04:08.130 --> 06:04:08.720
Vevin: I move on.

3058
06:04:08.720 --> 06:04:09.380
Monal Kumar: I can't he?

3059
06:04:09.380 --> 06:04:29.239
Vevin: AI to understand the whole context, because, you know, if it has understanding of the full context, you know, it can write better test cases, because otherwise, you know, you just give a story, it writes the test cases. But let's say, you know, there is some more knowledge of the application, what AI would need, so that it can write much better test cases for that particular story.

3060
06:04:29.250 --> 06:04:30.170
Vevin: So it's not, you know…

3061
06:04:30.170 --> 06:04:39.430
Monal Kumar: That's a complex thing. For that, you need to build a whole ecosystem for your application to be connected with the RAG, and your application to be connected with the main application which company is using.

3062
06:04:40.370 --> 06:04:41.030
Vevin: Right.

3063
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.710
Monal Kumar: Huh?

3064
06:04:41.710 --> 06:04:59.260
Vevin: So, I mean, that's, like, you know, my vision, which I was… you know, because, you know, like, putting a, you know, just a requirement and test cases is a very straightforward thing which anybody can do, right? You pick the requirement, you put it to, you know, the prompt, and you, like you said, you know, structure or the prompt, and, you know, tell it in what format you want test cases, and boom, it'll give you right there.

3065
06:04:59.400 --> 06:05:02.809
Vevin: But, you know, if you want to build something big where, you know, the AI

3066
06:05:03.210 --> 06:05:07.450
Vevin: understanding of the context of the application, it can be a much better

3067
06:05:07.650 --> 06:05:12.419
Vevin: You know, like, it can give you much better, you know, test cases of how you validate the application.

3068
06:05:12.690 --> 06:05:16.040
Monal Kumar: You can, you can plan this, this is, this is doable, yeah.

3069
06:05:16.580 --> 06:05:19.450
Vevin: Okay, yup. Yep, thank you, thank you.

3070
06:05:19.450 --> 06:05:20.420
Monal Kumar: That's great, Evan.

3071
06:05:20.540 --> 06:05:21.710
Monal Kumar: Nice talking to you.

3072
06:05:21.870 --> 06:05:22.700
Vevin: Yeah, same here.

3073
06:05:23.610 --> 06:05:33.280
Monal Kumar: Alright, guys, whoever doubt is already created, again, I'm repeating because some of the doubts might be the same. So, unraise your hand if you're the one.

3074
06:05:33.580 --> 06:05:34.740
Monal Kumar: And,

3075
06:05:35.280 --> 06:05:40.799
Monal Kumar: I can see… okay, Amuda, you are next. And guys, just give me a second, give me a second.

3076
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:39.010
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3077
06:06:39.800 --> 06:06:41.000
Monal Kumar: Amuda, you're next.

3078
06:06:41.000 --> 06:06:43.180
Amudha: Yeah. Hi. Yes, hi.

3079
06:06:43.900 --> 06:06:50.289
Monal Kumar: It was Ravdeep. Yes. Hey, Ravdeep, sorry about that, Anoda.

3080
06:06:50.480 --> 06:06:57.099
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Yes, hi, Munil. Thank you for such an insightful session, and it's been a long session, though.

3081
06:06:57.100 --> 06:06:58.820
Monal Kumar: Yes. Thank you.

3082
06:06:58.990 --> 06:07:09.090
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: And so, just to give you a perspective, I'm transitioning into the AI field, and I just started PhD in agentic AI in Australia.

3083
06:07:09.540 --> 06:07:10.230
Monal Kumar: Nice.

3084
06:07:10.230 --> 06:07:25.199
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Yeah, so, yeah, thank you. So, so, you know, in this one, I'll be building an agent and deploying it in industry, because it's an industry partnership project. It's a three years project.

3085
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:26.160
Monal Kumar: Nice.

3086
06:07:26.160 --> 06:07:26.550
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Right?

3087
06:07:26.770 --> 06:07:41.319
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: So, now, in this one, I'll be building and deploying an agent. So, I'm directly working on agentic AI problem, right? So, my question is, what do you suggest? Should I go the traditional route or modern route?

3088
06:07:42.270 --> 06:07:50.150
Monal Kumar: This traditional route is for someone who wants to learn this whole data science ecosystem, and wants to be ready.

3089
06:07:50.370 --> 06:07:56.069
Monal Kumar: And if you think that you're already ready on that, then this is a different path, Ravi, I can say.

3090
06:07:56.940 --> 06:08:04.920
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: I'd say, you know, I'm not, I don't have in-depth knowledge of data science, complete data science.

3091
06:08:04.920 --> 06:08:15.489
Monal Kumar: that what exactly you want. This is a learning path, and if you want a path where you exactly want to focus on agentic, then we already… we have a different path for that.

3092
06:08:15.630 --> 06:08:16.920
Monal Kumar: So.

3093
06:08:16.920 --> 06:08:17.300
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Yeah.

3094
06:08:17.300 --> 06:08:30.210
Monal Kumar: maybe you need to define that, do you want to learn as well as learn the latest thing, or skip the learn and learn the new thing? So, that is something which you need to literally decide on that.

3095
06:08:31.000 --> 06:08:54.549
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Because I was thinking, if I go the modern route, so probably I'd be able to, you know, learn, generative AI and agentic AI in depth, and then, you know, I can start working on the problem that I have at hand. And as I go along, then I can probably deep dive into data science in general as well.

3096
06:08:55.590 --> 06:09:11.920
Monal Kumar: You can do that. You can do that in parallel, you want to go there first as well. So, do you… are you well versed in, connecting with databases, understanding, logic, ML, data, and everything? Have you ever… ever done all of that?

3097
06:09:11.920 --> 06:09:12.310
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: seat.

3098
06:09:12.310 --> 06:09:12.760
Monal Kumar: That's awesome.

3099
06:09:13.830 --> 06:09:30.400
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Yeah, I, you know, in terms of, machine learning, I, I have a very basic understanding, not, in-depth understanding of that, and, you know, I, I'm, I have, basics of Python.

3100
06:09:30.400 --> 06:09:37.879
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: And I'm basically working on that level, and I've been working on generative AI and agentic AI as well.

3101
06:09:39.380 --> 06:09:47.020
Monal Kumar: Product, for now, I think Agentic will suit you, but,

3102
06:09:47.820 --> 06:10:04.199
Monal Kumar: check the syllabus of the agentic, because I'm not sure that… are you looking for the exact topic to learn? And I'm also sure… I'm also not sure that you are sure that you are… what exactly you're looking for. You're looking for a particular topic to learn? You're looking for agentic? Because you're already working in Agentic.

3103
06:10:04.450 --> 06:10:07.230
Monal Kumar: Are you not able to do… so, what exactly is the.

3104
06:10:07.230 --> 06:10:18.780
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: No, I, you know, I just started my PhD, two to three months ago, and right now I'm in the process of understanding the pain points and the problem itself.

3105
06:10:18.780 --> 06:10:38.710
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: And, so… so what I'm, so what I'm thinking is, is it, a good way to first, get into, like, take the modern route, and first do generative AI and agentic AI, and then I can start working on my PhD problem as well, along with that, because, I'll have to…

3106
06:10:38.710 --> 06:10:43.920
Monal Kumar: to go for you, because you don't require machine learning right now, machine learning, deep learning, alright?

3107
06:10:44.160 --> 06:10:52.000
Monal Kumar: But, if in any scenario, you require to work with model, evaluation, learn all of those things.

3108
06:10:52.150 --> 06:11:04.730
Monal Kumar: in future, or in the… within this project, I'm not sure what is the scope of your agent, whether your agent is going to call the machine learning, your agent is going to do the forecasting, because generative models have no forecasting, right?

3109
06:11:04.730 --> 06:11:15.879
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Yeah, yes, and no, it's not going to be, forecasting, or it's not going to be model evaluation, or anything like that. Any probabilistic modeling, you're not going to work on that, right? Yeah, yeah.

3110
06:11:15.880 --> 06:11:22.000
Monal Kumar: So, if that is not the case, then… Learning this way is…

3111
06:11:22.200 --> 06:11:26.529
Monal Kumar: Something which you are not, which you don't have to do right now.

3112
06:11:27.080 --> 06:11:32.250
Monal Kumar: Okay. So that is something which you need to decide, whether to keep this in parallel, or do something else.

3113
06:11:32.740 --> 06:11:43.910
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Okay, so, do you think, I should… for now, I should switch to, the modern route, the Agentic AI and Generative AI course that's starting soon?

3114
06:11:44.040 --> 06:11:52.659
Monal Kumar: See, that is something which I will say that, first think that whether you want… if you don't want this, then go there.

3115
06:11:53.280 --> 06:12:07.779
Monal Kumar: If you have a right answer for this one, that no, I don't want this path, I want that path, then only go there. But if you think that, I also want to learn this path, but I also want to go into agent, then the parallel path is for you. Do both of them parallel.

3116
06:12:08.700 --> 06:12:24.450
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Okay, so what I'm now thinking is that, you know, if I do the generative AI and agent take AI first, then as I go along, I would like to also get into depth of machine learning and everything, deep learning.

3117
06:12:24.450 --> 06:12:32.170
Monal Kumar: And that would help me in the long term, but to start with, I think immediately I would need generative AI and agentic AI.

3118
06:12:32.570 --> 06:12:35.309
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: At this point, what do you think?

3119
06:12:38.780 --> 06:12:46.159
Monal Kumar: That is a good path for you, but you need to talk to the team, whether… everyone, you need to talk with the team on how much of that is possible.

3120
06:12:46.600 --> 06:12:52.550
Monal Kumar: Because we don't have that badge yet, alright? It is going to be out. So maybe check with the team what they are saying, alright?

3121
06:12:53.190 --> 06:13:03.260
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: I think I did check with Ahsan, and he said that it'll be out, I think it'll be, on the website within a week.

3122
06:13:03.260 --> 06:13:08.780
Monal Kumar: And then, I don't know, I think… did you mention a little while ago that it's starting next month?

3123
06:13:09.750 --> 06:13:13.849
Monal Kumar: See, we have said next one, but we don't have the date, right?

3124
06:13:13.850 --> 06:13:15.419
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: But it'll be starting soon, right?

3125
06:13:15.420 --> 06:13:18.950
Monal Kumar: It will be starting soon, that we can see. It will be starting soon. Okay. Yes, yes.

3126
06:13:18.950 --> 06:13:25.479
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: Okay. Okay, so I think I'll, then better start with that, and then once I'm, you know.

3127
06:13:25.480 --> 06:13:37.730
Monal Kumar: Also, that is more on the generative LLMs, training the LLM part, okay? So if you, check the syllabus also once it is out, or go with the RAG or Agent class that is also present in our course.

3128
06:13:37.940 --> 06:13:42.570
Monal Kumar: All right? Yes, yes, sure. We do have a different service for that. Yeah, sure, okay.

3129
06:13:42.570 --> 06:13:45.229
RAVDEEP SINGH SANDHU SANDHU: I'll do that, yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you.

3130
06:13:45.230 --> 06:13:46.090
Monal Kumar: Thank you very much.

3131
06:13:48.890 --> 06:13:51.259
Monal Kumar: Right. Amuda, you're next.

3132
06:13:52.150 --> 06:13:53.579
Amudha: Yes, Monu.

3133
06:13:53.700 --> 06:14:13.019
Amudha: I want to check, whether I have chosen the course route. I'm a full-stack developer with 8-plus years experience in C++, C Sharp, and SQL. And, I want to, go in a technical path.

3134
06:14:13.420 --> 06:14:17.100
Amudha: So, is it the right course that I have authored?

3135
06:14:17.100 --> 06:14:22.390
Monal Kumar: Yes, if you want to get started and want to build the correct foundation, this is the right course for me.

3136
06:14:23.940 --> 06:14:24.610
Amudha: Yeah, hopefully.

3137
06:14:24.610 --> 06:14:29.700
Monal Kumar: But, yeah, if you want to get started and understand all the things from there. All right?

3138
06:14:30.290 --> 06:14:48.350
Amudha: Okay, and next, is, I'm planning to buy a personal laptop for personal use, and I would like to use that for, this course also. And I checked with counseling team, they said, I can go with the i5.

3139
06:14:48.420 --> 06:14:59.869
Monal Kumar: i5 8GB RAM is the minimum requirement, go with i5 as the minimum, or go with the AMD one, right? Any AMD Ryzen processors is also fine, but, comparable to iPad, go with the.

3140
06:15:01.300 --> 06:15:06.819
Amudha: Okay, and regarding GPU, is, GPU mandatory, or…

3141
06:15:06.820 --> 06:15:19.579
Monal Kumar: GPU is not mandatory for GPU, we have Google Collab as the free provider. If you want to use GPU in your system, want to train your own model in the system, then you require GPU, otherwise you don't require GPU.

3142
06:15:21.170 --> 06:15:21.650
Amudha: Okay.

3143
06:15:21.650 --> 06:15:31.999
Monal Kumar: Yeah, we usually train models on cloud, so I would not suggest to go for GPU until and unless you want to do your own research or train your own models whenever you want.

3144
06:15:32.130 --> 06:15:34.540
Monal Kumar: then you require GPU, otherwise don't require it.

3145
06:15:35.410 --> 06:15:41.660
Amudha: Okay, and what is the, hard disk space that will be required?

3146
06:15:41.940 --> 06:15:48.510
Monal Kumar: If you… see, our software that we have is not going to take more than 5-6 GB.

3147
06:15:49.050 --> 06:16:05.350
Monal Kumar: And OS will take probably around 30, 40 GB of space, alright? So, you're okay with 500GB also, but if you are someone who wants to watch movies, want to keep a lot of documentation, or a lot of files, big zip files, images, personal photos.

3148
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:12.390
Monal Kumar: then I would suggest you to go for 1TB. Otherwise, if strictly only for work, 500 TVs all… 500 GB is also fine.

3149
06:16:14.690 --> 06:16:16.500
Amudha: Okay, thank you, Monu.

3150
06:16:20.280 --> 06:16:22.600
Monal Kumar: Right? Then we have,

3151
06:16:52.130 --> 06:16:55.840
Monal Kumar: We have… Musab. Musab, you're next.

3152
06:16:59.610 --> 06:17:00.640
Musab: Hello?

3153
06:17:00.900 --> 06:17:02.070
Monal Kumar: Hey, what's up? Yes.

3154
06:17:03.040 --> 06:17:04.499
Musab: Hello, good afternoon, sir.

3155
06:17:04.720 --> 06:17:05.910
Monal Kumar: Good afternoon, good afternoon.

3156
06:17:05.910 --> 06:17:20.099
Musab: Sir, I have a related query about… I am… I have working on JRF, Junior research position, NIA University. I have recently completed my master, which is electrical engineering field.

3157
06:17:20.260 --> 06:17:34.850
Musab: But, I am working on embedded systems, and so I am related to work… now related to working on an industrial project with Ambited Systems, where I manufacture,

3158
06:17:35.180 --> 06:17:52.200
Musab: prototype with battery health management, where I am use the database and Grafana for visualization. But now, I think I am moved forward on the problem statement, because my professor said, you will learn to the federatic learning, where we implement.

3159
06:17:52.200 --> 06:17:52.690
Monal Kumar: learning.

3160
06:17:52.690 --> 06:17:53.930
Musab: this?

3161
06:17:54.060 --> 06:17:56.660
Musab: Yes, sir. From federated Learning.

3162
06:18:01.220 --> 06:18:01.830
Monal Kumar: What's up?

3163
06:18:01.960 --> 06:18:02.739
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

3164
06:18:02.740 --> 06:18:10.520
Musab: of… I have recently knowledge about the machine learning, because I was previously

3165
06:18:11.520 --> 06:18:21.679
Musab: purchase a critical course, so I have real basic knowledge about machine learning and deep learning. Now, I am forward to the detailed learning part. So, the PRB…

3166
06:18:21.680 --> 06:18:23.339
Monal Kumar: Learning is something which we're not doing.

3167
06:18:23.730 --> 06:18:26.860
Monal Kumar: It is a different domain, yeah, yeah. It is a different domain.

3168
06:18:27.240 --> 06:18:36.050
Musab: Yes, sir, yes, so I think, my question is, okay, how I can gain knowledge about fair data learning? So, I…

3169
06:18:36.050 --> 06:18:49.799
Monal Kumar: learning is something that we do a lot of experimentation, and it is mostly present in the research. I do know someone from my previous batch that was working in computer vision federated learning, federated learning in terms of

3170
06:18:49.800 --> 06:19:02.420
Monal Kumar: Yeah, he was working in government data, okay? That's why he required federated learning. But apart from that, that is mostly a research kind of field. From the research paper, try to convert that into the coding part of it. That's what we can do.

3171
06:19:03.250 --> 06:19:04.100
Monal Kumar: What's up?

3172
06:19:04.410 --> 06:19:06.760
Monal Kumar: Oh, there are technicians.

3173
06:19:07.020 --> 06:19:15.140
Musab: Okay, so, sir, I have recently know about inferated learning and machine learning, there are a difference between, because…

3174
06:19:15.140 --> 06:19:19.060
Monal Kumar: There's a difference in terms of learning, learning, data sharing and other things.

3175
06:19:19.370 --> 06:19:20.400
Musab: Yes, ma'am.

3176
06:19:20.630 --> 06:19:29.919
Musab: So, the question is… the second question is, so I have… where is the path, I can learn about the fat adrenaline? Because I…

3177
06:19:29.920 --> 06:19:30.710
Monal Kumar: 50 bucks.

3178
06:19:31.570 --> 06:19:32.750
Musab: Okay.

3179
06:19:32.750 --> 06:19:50.449
Monal Kumar: research paper, and read about it, and then try to use LLM, try to use… if you're not… if you don't want to code a lot, at least try to have some basic framework from the LLM, that this is what I want, and then keep on doing research on that. Pedative learning is something you don't have a framework for that directly.

3180
06:19:51.680 --> 06:19:59.239
Musab: Okay, so go, sir, yes, sir, my future plan is to doing PhD because of my embedded system.

3181
06:19:59.560 --> 06:20:01.340
Monal Kumar: It's really nice. So, that…

3182
06:20:01.480 --> 06:20:10.240
Musab: So, the thing is, this course is beneficial for my embedded system, future energy predictions. My base,

3183
06:20:10.240 --> 06:20:10.630
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3184
06:20:10.630 --> 06:20:13.279
Musab: The main field is energy monitoring and energy production.

3185
06:20:13.280 --> 06:20:20.359
Monal Kumar: Yes, it will be beneficial. See, what… what are all these predictions? Prediction that every basic of any prediction or understanding is what?

3186
06:20:20.630 --> 06:20:26.179
Monal Kumar: Learning the patterns, understanding data, what are numbers, how numbers correlated, and other things, yes?

3187
06:20:26.700 --> 06:20:30.949
Monal Kumar: If you understand that, that same thing can be applied to other places.

3188
06:20:32.510 --> 06:20:33.549
Musab: Yes, sir, yes sir, yes.

3189
06:20:33.550 --> 06:20:34.690
Monal Kumar: So, it'll be helpful.

3190
06:20:34.710 --> 06:20:41.649
Musab: So, what is the difference between a database and AI database?

3191
06:20:42.570 --> 06:20:44.120
Monal Kumar: this AI database.

3192
06:20:44.950 --> 06:20:47.220
Musab: There is only one database, Usab.

3193
06:20:47.220 --> 06:21:06.630
Monal Kumar: We have vector database. AI database is nothing… like, you might have… see, if you combine database with, you can say LLM, then it will become AI database. You can… you can, instead of writing query, you can write language… in natural language processing, and then you will get your answer.

3194
06:21:07.930 --> 06:21:16.009
Monal Kumar: There is nothing like an AI database, it is just an integration of LLM into the database. Database itself is something that… where we store data.

3195
06:21:16.110 --> 06:21:20.019
Monal Kumar: And we have a language to retrieve those data. Alright?

3196
06:21:20.970 --> 06:21:23.780
Musab: Okay, okay, thank you so much, sir. Thank you for your answer, sir.

3197
06:21:23.780 --> 06:21:25.200
Monal Kumar: Yeah, thank you.

3198
06:21:25.420 --> 06:21:26.300
Musab: Thanks.

3199
06:21:28.770 --> 06:21:32.990
Monal Kumar: Right? Then we have… FFCS1.

3200
06:21:33.460 --> 06:21:37.809
Monal Kumar: I know the name is pretty… like, robot with FFCS ones?

3201
06:21:39.960 --> 06:21:43.569
ffcs1: Hi, good afternoon. Good afternoon, Manu.

3202
06:21:43.740 --> 06:21:47.369
ffcs1: I'm sorry, I couldn't get my right name, my name…

3203
06:21:47.370 --> 06:21:47.760
Monal Kumar: Fifth.

3204
06:21:47.760 --> 06:21:49.739
ffcs1: My, my, yeah.

3205
06:21:49.740 --> 06:21:51.540
Monal Kumar: Mahesh, yes. Hey Mahesh.

3206
06:21:52.050 --> 06:21:59.440
ffcs1: first of all, thank you for your time. Very, very expensive, and thank you, thank you very much for it.

3207
06:22:00.080 --> 06:22:00.800
Monal Kumar: Integrator.

3208
06:22:02.060 --> 06:22:12.999
ffcs1: I… just to recap, you've touched system requirements. That was a question I had, so we could do with cloud. Then you had certs.

3209
06:22:13.000 --> 06:22:22.290
ffcs1: I'm thinking of doing, Microsoft certification, which, which some… which you did mention, as in, for some people.

3210
06:22:22.290 --> 06:22:32.569
ffcs1: To touch on videos for Gen AI and agentic AIs. So Microsoft… well, I was researching certification in Microsoft.

3211
06:22:33.230 --> 06:22:50.659
ffcs1: Microsoft has, the videos on Gen AI and Agentic AIs, which you did recommend, searching on YouTube as well. Then I went on to, I have my background in, automation and testing.

3212
06:22:50.980 --> 06:23:09.699
ffcs1: which one of your candidates from Canada was asking about as well. So, I'm taking this course, I'm thinking of doing simultaneously some YouTubes on AI tools for automation and testing.

3213
06:23:10.080 --> 06:23:10.590
Monal Kumar: Alright.

3214
06:23:10.590 --> 06:23:16.819
ffcs1: Then you, you, you, you touched very well on the various routes.

3215
06:23:16.900 --> 06:23:26.450
ffcs1: I'm fine with doing this one, go slow. I'm basically based in Australia since the last 20 years.

3216
06:23:26.450 --> 06:23:37.099
ffcs1: But I'll take on a break and come back here. And since I touched on your curriculum and all, which has got good 27 modules, 94

3217
06:23:37.100 --> 06:23:43.329
ffcs1: topics and all. I thought of staying here for a year in India, now I'm in India right now.

3218
06:23:43.460 --> 06:23:52.969
ffcs1: So, yeah, I'm thinking of, staying here for this very course for the whole year.

3219
06:23:53.140 --> 06:24:08.640
ffcs1: And the final question before, I take any of your time is that I have various domains where I've worked on… so I've worked on telco domains.

3220
06:24:08.650 --> 06:24:19.840
ffcs1: I worked on banking, financial services, and insurance. I then transitioned to Google Amazon APIs, affiliate marketing.

3221
06:24:19.840 --> 06:24:35.369
ffcs1: And these days, I'm doing, blockchain data, and using their APIs on blockchain, on-chain data, as well as… so, CeFi and DeFi, centralized finance and decentralized finance, as well as a bit of trading, and… which is TradeFi.

3222
06:24:35.540 --> 06:24:53.919
ffcs1: So, I was just wondering if, if, I'm putting in a request, and hopefully, other students of yours, during the year would want to touch on blockchain data, either CFI, DeFi, or even TradeFi, like.

3223
06:24:53.920 --> 06:24:59.839
ffcs1: the trading data and financial data for any of the projects? Yes, please.

3224
06:24:59.840 --> 06:25:05.819
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes, if you can provide me, and I do have an understanding of those, I can create something from those, yeah?

3225
06:25:07.540 --> 06:25:16.069
ffcs1: Yes, that's all I'd wanted a bit on the financial aspect as well, so thank you, thank you very much for that.

3226
06:25:16.070 --> 06:25:32.190
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure, thank you very much. And to improve your chances of everything, because you're here in India and, working on this course, to improve your chances, just watch and learn as much things as possible. As I mentioned, my goal is to become… is to,

3227
06:25:32.360 --> 06:25:33.970
Monal Kumar: Make everyone engineer.

3228
06:25:33.980 --> 06:25:52.660
Monal Kumar: And this course is not enough, not enough in terms of… there are hundreds of things that we want to learn, right? This course is the constant, thing which we'll be learning in the year, but once this course is over, in the meantime, in parallel to this course, you can learn from the YouTube, create a lot of awesome projects.

3229
06:25:52.660 --> 06:25:55.349
Monal Kumar: learn cloud and other things, that will be very, very helpful.

3230
06:25:56.100 --> 06:25:56.760
Monal Kumar: Nope.

3231
06:25:58.060 --> 06:26:04.739
Monal Kumar: Thank you, thank you. Looking forward to working with you guys and the team, and everyone else as well. Thank you, thank you very much.

3232
06:26:08.400 --> 06:26:13.860
Monal Kumar: Alright, 10… We have… Chivongi?

3233
06:26:14.600 --> 06:26:18.159
Monal Kumar: After Shivangi, we will have sign-up. So first, Shivangi.

3234
06:26:19.840 --> 06:26:20.860
Shivangi Chauhan: Hi, Mobile.

3235
06:26:20.860 --> 06:26:22.380
Monal Kumar: Okay, Shivani, yes.

3236
06:26:22.580 --> 06:26:24.290
Shivangi Chauhan: Thank you for your time.

3237
06:26:25.630 --> 06:26:39.560
Shivangi Chauhan: Actually, currently, I am working in the IT audit domain. Firstly, I used to work as a business analyst, like, for 10 months, and now I am working in IT audit profile in Assurance.

3238
06:26:39.820 --> 06:26:46.339
Shivangi Chauhan: Like… It's a complete start, new start for me. I have some questions, like.

3239
06:26:46.560 --> 06:27:03.030
Shivangi Chauhan: how the analysis we will be doing here is different from the data analyst point. Like, the roadmap for the job profiles which you showed from your LinkedIn profile, it has that analysis point, analysis and computation point.

3240
06:27:03.090 --> 06:27:13.970
Shivangi Chauhan: I have seen that, and where you have mentioned, like, Python, NumPy, plus Java and Power BI, so I just want you to, explain that. And also, like.

3241
06:27:13.970 --> 06:27:27.360
Shivangi Chauhan: See, I… I'm on a probation period for 6 months, so… and we have, like, in probation, notice period is of, like, 1 to 2 months, so I have a good chance if I want to, like, switch early.

3242
06:27:27.400 --> 06:27:32.509
Shivangi Chauhan: So, I want to know from your perspective as how should I phase my…

3243
06:27:32.510 --> 06:27:33.399
Monal Kumar: How much you enrolled?

3244
06:27:34.090 --> 06:27:35.400
Monal Kumar: I have…

3245
06:27:35.970 --> 06:27:44.629
Shivangi Chauhan: I have time, like, working is okay, but I can give 4 to 5, even 6 hours daily if I want.

3246
06:27:45.210 --> 06:27:46.000
Shivangi Chauhan: I can.

3247
06:27:46.000 --> 06:27:52.909
Monal Kumar: depends on what you are doing in those 6 hours. This course is already, like, 3 hours…

3248
06:27:53.270 --> 06:27:55.219
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah, 3 to 4.

3249
06:27:55.420 --> 06:27:58.969
Monal Kumar: 3-4 hours, 3 times a week, right?

3250
06:27:59.210 --> 06:28:04.829
Monal Kumar: And, you cannot directly jump to a place if our base is not clear until.

3251
06:28:04.830 --> 06:28:05.380
Shivangi Chauhan: Just keep moving.

3252
06:28:05.610 --> 06:28:14.750
Monal Kumar: little bit of Python and a little bit of Python is there, then we'll be able to jump to more places, alright? Python will take around one month of time.

3253
06:28:15.190 --> 06:28:22.950
Monal Kumar: So, what I will suggest is that, yes, same thing I'm suggesting, that is.

3254
06:28:23.240 --> 06:28:40.370
Monal Kumar: In the meantime, while you're learning Python, have an understanding of at least a conceptual understanding of what is a RAG, what are LLMs, what is a different model. That does not require technical understanding. At least, if you heard those names, it will be faster for you to grasp it later.

3255
06:28:40.470 --> 06:28:41.730
Monal Kumar: Are you getting my point?

3256
06:28:41.910 --> 06:28:42.620
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah.

3257
06:28:43.110 --> 06:29:02.789
Monal Kumar: So, create a list of things, use ChatGPT World 79. First, create a list, ask them to maybe fill those lists to a better list, or ask them to create a list that you want to learn on a high level. Just watch a YouTube video, simple, not a technical one, not a coding one. Write what exactly that topic is.

3258
06:29:03.000 --> 06:29:04.350
Monal Kumar: Are you getting my point?

3259
06:29:04.350 --> 06:29:05.159
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah.

3260
06:29:05.160 --> 06:29:12.789
Monal Kumar: Even if they are doing coding, skip the coding part, or just listen to it, and then ignore it, but have an idea that what we are doing.

3261
06:29:13.100 --> 06:29:16.199
Shivangi Chauhan: Once we cover more of those things, then.

3262
06:29:16.200 --> 06:29:21.379
Monal Kumar: I will suggest, if you are ready before that, I will ask you to create projects. You can connect with me on LinkedIn.

3263
06:29:21.580 --> 06:29:27.010
Monal Kumar: Because I think, when I will start the project part.

3264
06:29:27.610 --> 06:29:31.669
Monal Kumar: It will be too late for you to more things, right?

3265
06:29:32.450 --> 06:29:37.670
Monal Kumar: Connect with me on LinkedIn. Once it is done, let me know what are the topics you have already covered. Then I will give you the next part.

3266
06:29:37.670 --> 06:29:40.539
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah, I'm connected on your LinkedIn.

3267
06:29:40.540 --> 06:29:41.240
Monal Kumar: Pardon?

3268
06:29:41.550 --> 06:29:43.029
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah, yeah, but…

3269
06:29:43.030 --> 06:29:45.149
Monal Kumar: And on the data analysis part.

3270
06:29:45.150 --> 06:29:47.869
Shivangi Chauhan: What is actual data analysis, can you tell me?

3271
06:29:48.130 --> 06:29:52.100
Monal Kumar: And this is not an interview. This is not an interview, from your understanding.

3272
06:29:52.910 --> 06:30:01.749
Shivangi Chauhan: Just simply, we get a complete mess of data, and we have to find meaningful things from that data, which is delivered for us.

3273
06:30:01.750 --> 06:30:02.490
Monal Kumar: Same thing.

3274
06:30:02.670 --> 06:30:17.179
Monal Kumar: You can do data analysis with Microsoft Excel, you can do with Google Sheet, you can do with Power BI, you can do with Tableau, you can do with Python, alright? If you do with Tableau and Power BI, you can create dashboards from your analysis, alright?

3275
06:30:17.380 --> 06:30:17.930
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah.

3276
06:30:18.460 --> 06:30:23.660
Monal Kumar: And the dashboard… the end goal of the dashboard is from management, right?

3277
06:30:23.920 --> 06:30:24.510
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah.

3278
06:30:24.510 --> 06:30:26.609
Monal Kumar: For management to see and take decision.

3279
06:30:26.810 --> 06:30:36.299
Monal Kumar: The… if I talk about, in terms of Python, in Python, you can do data analysis with normal Python, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, which you mentioned.

3280
06:30:36.410 --> 06:30:45.209
Monal Kumar: But the end goal is to create a dashboard? No. End goal is to take decision, and then from those decisions, go to the machine learning part.

3281
06:30:45.540 --> 06:30:57.860
Monal Kumar: So, in Power API and Tableau, our goal is management people dashboard. Here, the goal is analysis, take decision, and then use the decision to create a better model.

3282
06:30:58.210 --> 06:31:13.009
Monal Kumar: Or to fix the data. Are you getting my point? The end goal here is different, so data analysis will remain same, but how we do data analysis, the coding will be here, there are a lot of things. The way we do it is different, but the ideology is the same.

3283
06:31:14.160 --> 06:31:23.509
Shivangi Chauhan: Okay. Yeah, just want you to brush up again on that, like, if I'm having 5 to 6 months, so first I need to…

3284
06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:33.680
Monal Kumar: learn the basics, right, which you will be… Yes, if you can, if you can, learn Python as fast as possible in Python also. We have… Krisha showed in the morning, right?

3285
06:31:33.680 --> 06:31:34.010
Shivangi Chauhan: No.

3286
06:31:34.010 --> 06:31:35.289
Monal Kumar: I have one video.

3287
06:31:35.680 --> 06:31:46.410
Monal Kumar: Python, if you're ready in Python, I think it can be done within one month, right? You can do it within one or two weeks. Complete that, then ping me on LinkedIn, okay?

3288
06:31:46.660 --> 06:31:48.660
Shivangi Chauhan: Okay, after, after Python?

3289
06:31:48.760 --> 06:31:51.159
Monal Kumar: I will tell you what to do next, okay?

3290
06:31:51.530 --> 06:32:00.590
Monal Kumar: Just tell me, sir, I've completed Python, you told me these things, because in LinkedIn, I might not be able to remember everyone's name. So tell me, this is what I have said, and this is what you completed.

3291
06:32:00.840 --> 06:32:01.470
Monal Kumar: And then…

3292
06:32:01.470 --> 06:32:02.060
Shivangi Chauhan: Understood.

3293
06:32:02.060 --> 06:32:04.070
Monal Kumar: I will turn to the next point, alright?

3294
06:32:04.070 --> 06:32:10.079
Shivangi Chauhan: Okay, Python, I should be completing with the old… your… that AI course? Yes, because you want.

3295
06:32:10.080 --> 06:32:11.600
Monal Kumar: to do it fast, yes?

3296
06:32:11.600 --> 06:32:16.690
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah. I have started also from that. I have started learning from that.

3297
06:32:16.690 --> 06:32:22.760
Monal Kumar: You can either watch, if you want to go super fast, watch Chris's YouTube Python playlist, okay?

3298
06:32:22.960 --> 06:32:32.619
Monal Kumar: That is super fast. If you want to go, in very depth understanding, if you don't understand from the super fast, then go with the Batch 1 recordings of Python.

3299
06:32:32.950 --> 06:32:33.490
Monal Kumar: Yes?

3300
06:32:33.490 --> 06:32:34.750
Shivangi Chauhan: So, yeah.

3301
06:32:34.860 --> 06:32:37.830
Monal Kumar: And, yeah, try to complete as soon as possible, let me know.

3302
06:32:38.210 --> 06:32:55.199
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah, also, what I have, like, asked… what I have, get from the old… the people I know who are in these data scientists roles for AI, they, mention, like, for big companies, they prefer DSA in first round that

3303
06:32:55.200 --> 06:33:02.670
Shivangi Chauhan: First round is for DSAE, when you are getting… In big companies, in Facebook, Google, Meta, in these companies, it will require.

3304
06:33:02.670 --> 06:33:18.360
Monal Kumar: But for now, in your current level, it will be very hard to directly go there, even with DSA. Because you require a lot of understandings also, right? You require exposure to the projects and other things. You can go there, but in 6 months, it is not possible right now.

3305
06:33:18.360 --> 06:33:33.860
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah, okay, I understand it. Just last question. See, if I'll be learning Python, and after that, what you will be telling, so even an analyst position at a good company would be grateful for me?

3306
06:33:33.860 --> 06:33:37.199
Monal Kumar: For analyst position, they will require Power BI and SQL.

3307
06:33:37.710 --> 06:33:39.200
Shivangi Chauhan: Oh, yeah, okay, secret.

3308
06:33:39.470 --> 06:33:48.619
Shivangi Chauhan: See, like, it's… I just believe, like, getting into the big company, a chance to get there, and then shifting internally would be better.

3309
06:33:48.890 --> 06:33:51.039
Shivangi Chauhan: Because I've seen… I know people who are…

3310
06:33:51.040 --> 06:33:57.519
Monal Kumar: you can do that. See, for Power BI, I will suggest, if you… Power BI is non-negotiable for data analysts, alright?

3311
06:33:58.260 --> 06:34:10.190
Monal Kumar: I would suggest you, there is one very good course in Udemy, from Krishna Academy, one is from Jayant, okay? Jayanth is one of our members. He created a Power BI course where we have a lot of projects also.

3312
06:34:10.480 --> 06:34:15.600
Monal Kumar: in Udemy, search Power BI, okay, and there you will find something from Christian Academy.

3313
06:34:15.600 --> 06:34:26.300
Shivangi Chauhan: Actually, I did Power BI one or two projects, but the problem was when I started doing projects by my own, I was not able to do.

3314
06:34:26.300 --> 06:34:36.269
Monal Kumar: That's why you need to learn more. You need to learn what exactly we are doing and why we are doing it. If you don't know the why, we will not… we will not be able to think about the why when we are doing the actual project, yes?

3315
06:34:36.470 --> 06:34:37.670
Shivangi Chauhan: Yeah.

3316
06:34:38.300 --> 06:34:40.010
Shivangi Chauhan: Okay, thank you so much.

3317
06:34:40.010 --> 06:34:41.559
Monal Kumar: Thank you, Randy.

3318
06:34:46.540 --> 06:34:48.969
Monal Kumar: Guys, unraise your hand if you're done, alright?

3319
06:34:50.260 --> 06:34:52.140
Monal Kumar: Sydam, you're next.

3320
06:34:58.560 --> 06:35:00.039
Monal Kumar: Adam, you're next.

3321
06:35:03.670 --> 06:35:04.490
Monal Kumar: Yay.

3322
06:35:06.470 --> 06:35:08.360
Monal Kumar: Salman, you're next.

3323
06:35:11.170 --> 06:35:11.790
Salman Habeeb: Oh.

3324
06:35:12.330 --> 06:35:13.670
Salman Habeeb: Oh, hi.

3325
06:35:13.670 --> 06:35:15.390
Sairam Bhagath: Are you able to hear me?

3326
06:35:15.850 --> 06:35:19.070
Monal Kumar: Okay, Salman, sorry, let me see it.

3327
06:35:19.070 --> 06:35:19.650
Salman Habeeb: That's okay.

3328
06:35:20.050 --> 06:35:22.669
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, just wait for a few minutes, okay?

3329
06:35:24.060 --> 06:35:25.450
Monal Kumar: Sidearm?

3330
06:35:26.700 --> 06:35:44.790
Sairam Bhagath: Yeah, guys, sorry for the confusion. I just had an issue with my mic, sorry. So, the thing is, like, I have got an experience of close to 16 years, and most of it is into administrative side, like, I am an Oracle DBA, I, work on Oracle, Mongo.

3331
06:35:45.030 --> 06:35:54.400
Sairam Bhagath: PostgreSQL and Neo4j. So, these are the databases, and also, I am a, daily well-versed with even Oracle Exadata.

3332
06:35:54.500 --> 06:36:01.179
Sairam Bhagath: Coming on the application side. So, appliance side. So, that is my experience. So…

3333
06:36:01.210 --> 06:36:20.640
Sairam Bhagath: I just wanted to ask with you, like, how can I leverage my experience with this course? My, my overall idea of joining this course was to learn everything from scratch, but, just, I wanted your know-how and also your experience to help me, like, how I can take it forward.

3334
06:36:21.940 --> 06:36:24.350
Monal Kumar: First of all,

3335
06:36:24.850 --> 06:36:33.579
Monal Kumar: I would suggest you to take anything forward into the direction which you know, once you complete a big chunk of this course, at least the half, 50% part of this course, alright?

3336
06:36:33.580 --> 06:36:34.100
Sairam Bhagath: Complete now.

3337
06:36:34.100 --> 06:36:37.420
Monal Kumar: Then once you start going… okay, I can hear my voice…

3338
06:36:37.420 --> 06:36:41.219
Sairam Bhagath: Okay? Okay, I can hear my voice.

3339
06:36:42.980 --> 06:36:45.760
Sairam Bhagath: Okay, let me, let me mute myself first.

3340
06:36:45.790 --> 06:36:48.670
Monal Kumar: Sure. Yeah, yeah, alright. Yeah, this is better.

3341
06:36:48.770 --> 06:36:56.179
Monal Kumar: Then, what I will suggest you, once we complete the generative part of this course.

3342
06:36:56.420 --> 06:37:11.520
Monal Kumar: In Oracle, they have a lot of new findings. In Oracle, they have a vector database from the Oracle as well, and they do a lot of awesome things. I have heard that, okay? I cannot see because it requires a subscription on that, right?

3343
06:37:11.520 --> 06:37:27.190
Monal Kumar: But a lot of people are using Oracle back to databases and others. What you can do from the generator, you can go to the RAC side and convert your Oracle and Oracle expertise with the Oracle itself. Oracle has those functionalities provided. So create solution on the tech stacks which you already know.

3344
06:37:27.220 --> 06:37:33.599
Monal Kumar: And, you don't require conversion, you just need to use your current skill and create an AI project from there.

3345
06:37:34.770 --> 06:37:43.960
Monal Kumar: Your current skills requires to be integrated into AI to create a full-fledged application. To create those applications, create those projects, that's what I will say.

3346
06:37:44.370 --> 06:37:45.170
Monal Kumar: Sign up.

3347
06:37:47.110 --> 06:37:52.450
Monal Kumar: The first complete the generative part, then use your database and other things to create something awesome.

3348
06:37:52.450 --> 06:37:56.869
Sairam Bhagath: credit report, and use your database in person to create…

3349
06:37:57.740 --> 06:38:03.029
Sairam Bhagath: Shaman, I got it. I got it. I got what I wanted. Thank you.

3350
06:38:03.320 --> 06:38:04.799
Monal Kumar: Yeah, sure. Thank you very much.

3351
06:38:07.120 --> 06:38:10.609
Monal Kumar: All right, and then, Sanman, sorry about that, you are next.

3352
06:38:10.610 --> 06:38:17.329
Salman Habeeb: No problems. Munel, my name is Salman. I just wanted to give my quick introduction and then have some questions.

3353
06:38:17.330 --> 06:38:17.660
Monal Kumar: Sure.

3354
06:38:17.660 --> 06:38:27.350
Salman Habeeb: Okay, so my name is Shalman. I have around 20 years of experience in data engineering and data science. Nice. And I have completed master's in data science.

3355
06:38:27.710 --> 06:38:32.399
Salman Habeeb: And, basic data science and deep learning, that's all. Not Gen AI part.

3356
06:38:32.670 --> 06:38:50.800
Salman Habeeb: But the thing is, I have not shipped anything, you know, I have not, you know, built any project at the production level. So, I'm through with the data science concepts. The idea is, you know, I just wanted to revise all the concepts when I joined this course. So, in that angle, I'm just, you know, looking forward.

3357
06:38:50.920 --> 06:38:54.160
Monal Kumar: And I work as a data head in my company.

3358
06:38:54.160 --> 06:39:05.029
Salman Habeeb: And maybe I… yeah, maybe I just, you know, want to understand from you some of the use case which, you know, are some gen AI ideas which I can, you know, push into my team.

3359
06:39:05.030 --> 06:39:05.710
Monal Kumar: Sure.

3360
06:39:05.710 --> 06:39:07.140
Salman Habeeb: That is the basic idea.

3361
06:39:07.240 --> 06:39:17.480
Salman Habeeb: Okay, and my question is, you know, I joined, you know, Ultimate RAG Bootcamp, which is, you know, another course by…

3362
06:39:17.480 --> 06:39:18.730
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

3363
06:39:18.730 --> 06:39:28.910
Salman Habeeb: But I lost in between. I got sick, and then I took a vacation, and then that was somewhere, you know, lost in between. So, will you cover that part as well, as part of this? Because the course…

3364
06:39:28.910 --> 06:39:37.630
Monal Kumar: Specialization. Yeah, here we will, we will cover, like, 20-30% of each specialization, but there we have 70-80 more percent, plus more.

3365
06:39:38.170 --> 06:39:38.600
Salman Habeeb: Okay.

3366
06:39:38.600 --> 06:39:44.009
Monal Kumar: yeah, that is a different part. So, I think whatever we have… whatever you already know.

3367
06:39:44.490 --> 06:39:46.370
Monal Kumar: Less than that will be covered here.

3368
06:39:47.110 --> 06:39:50.050
Salman Habeeb: Okay, but at least we'll get some foundations of genius.

3369
06:39:50.050 --> 06:39:50.730
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

3370
06:39:50.730 --> 06:39:56.690
Salman Habeeb: Because I know GenAI is related to more, you know, generating content using, you know, the already trained model.

3371
06:39:56.690 --> 06:39:58.799
Monal Kumar: Generating, reasoning part of it, yes.

3372
06:39:59.050 --> 06:40:05.979
Salman Habeeb: Yes, and but what… I am not so clear about this agentic part, so will you be covering the agentic part as well?

3373
06:40:05.980 --> 06:40:10.890
Monal Kumar: Agentic part will be covered in this course, yes. By other mentor, agentic part will also be covered, yes.

3374
06:40:10.890 --> 06:40:11.500
Salman Habeeb: And it will…

3375
06:40:11.500 --> 06:40:23.539
Monal Kumar: In module number… yeah, in module number 25… from 25, okay? The module name is Agentic Rack System, 26 is MCP, 27 is Multi-Agent system.

3376
06:40:23.650 --> 06:40:25.720
Monal Kumar: Those are all of the agentic part.

3377
06:40:25.850 --> 06:40:26.670
Monal Kumar: Alright.

3378
06:40:27.800 --> 06:40:33.680
Salman Habeeb: And agents are, you know, different from RAG, because RAG is like, you know, building an additional meeting.

3379
06:40:33.680 --> 06:40:37.979
Monal Kumar: I will say, LLMs are… agents are LLMs.

3380
06:40:38.520 --> 06:40:43.030
Monal Kumar: Which has functionality to call APIs.

3381
06:40:43.130 --> 06:40:45.999
Monal Kumar: Or functions. That is the agent. That's all.

3382
06:40:47.040 --> 06:40:48.619
Salman Habeeb: Okay, okay, okay.

3383
06:40:48.620 --> 06:41:00.050
Monal Kumar: It's a LLM, which have a functionality to call a function, a Python function, or call an API. And both of them, we call it as a tool. So, agent call tools, tools are nothing but functions or APIs.

3384
06:41:00.260 --> 06:41:03.629
Salman Habeeb: And those APIs or function, one has to write themselves.

3385
06:41:03.790 --> 06:41:04.470
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3386
06:41:04.980 --> 06:41:07.430
Monal Kumar: Either someone has already created it for us.

3387
06:41:07.430 --> 06:41:07.860
Salman Habeeb: You didn't.

3388
06:41:07.860 --> 06:41:10.200
Monal Kumar: Or, yeah, or we will create for a buyer own.

3389
06:41:10.200 --> 06:41:12.240
Salman Habeeb: Like, booking a ticket, or taking a break.

3390
06:41:12.240 --> 06:41:15.539
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, we need to have that API, yeah, that's all.

3391
06:41:16.330 --> 06:41:17.710
Monal Kumar: Okay, okay.

3392
06:41:17.710 --> 06:41:22.070
Salman Habeeb: And I look forward, you know, brushing up my data science concepts.

3393
06:41:22.320 --> 06:41:30.169
Salman Habeeb: With you, and we'll be having… we'll be providing… you'll provide us a notebook, or we'll be just writing the code ourself? How is it like?

3394
06:41:30.170 --> 06:41:38.440
Monal Kumar: notebook I will provide, because, see, this is a long course. If I write each and everything, it will be long. In the previous courses, the patch one, I've already created a lot of notebooks, right?

3395
06:41:38.440 --> 06:41:39.340
Salman Habeeb: Not, not…

3396
06:41:39.340 --> 06:41:51.069
Monal Kumar: For the batch 2, what I will be doing is, we already have the code, we will do the deep dive understanding of what code is, what we have to do, how to think in terms of what should come in the next cell, we will do all of that.

3397
06:41:51.410 --> 06:41:57.049
Monal Kumar: I will provide the notebook, I will provide the writing explanation, what I'm doing in the notebook also.

3398
06:41:57.850 --> 06:42:01.409
Salman Habeeb: Okay, and you'll cover the deep learning part as well, you know.

3399
06:42:01.410 --> 06:42:02.210
Monal Kumar: learning, I'm.

3400
06:42:02.210 --> 06:42:02.650
Salman Habeeb: Auden.

3401
06:42:02.650 --> 06:42:03.110
Monal Kumar: over.

3402
06:42:04.170 --> 06:42:11.519
Monal Kumar: Yes, deep learning we will cover, R&I and other things we will cover, but I'm… I will not be the… I will not be teaching you that, but other mentors will be teaching you that.

3403
06:42:11.630 --> 06:42:17.410
Monal Kumar: Okay? Do check out the syllabus in more depth to understand what exactly we will be doing there.

3404
06:42:17.530 --> 06:42:21.530
Monal Kumar: But, yes, till Module 14?

3405
06:42:21.670 --> 06:42:25.600
Monal Kumar: You will be seeing me, okay, the NLP for machine learning part.

3406
06:42:26.630 --> 06:42:28.319
Salman Habeeb: So you'll be teaching the NLP.

3407
06:42:28.580 --> 06:42:32.350
Monal Kumar: NLP for machine learning, that is the first part, and LTK library is one-off encoding.

3408
06:42:32.350 --> 06:42:34.760
Salman Habeeb: Yeah, MLT library. Yeah, yeah.

3409
06:42:34.760 --> 06:42:39.050
Monal Kumar: It's the basic of when… the introduction of the NLP part, when I will be going there.

3410
06:42:39.050 --> 06:42:40.440
Salman Habeeb: before LLMs, that LLC.

3411
06:42:40.440 --> 06:42:43.360
Monal Kumar: Yeah, before the deep learning. Before the deep learning.

3412
06:42:43.610 --> 06:42:46.069
Salman Habeeb: NLP is also part of what deep learning, isn't it?

3413
06:42:46.070 --> 06:43:00.720
Monal Kumar: NLP is a part of deep learning, but there is a part of NLP, just like if you say regex. REGX also comes for the NLP, right? Extracting things, doing one-off encoding. One-out encoding, not a part of deep learning. It's a part of encoding that we do. If I talk about TFIDF,

3414
06:43:00.970 --> 06:43:08.429
Monal Kumar: We do consider NLP in a deep learning, but here we mention a module named as NLP for machine learning.

3415
06:43:08.900 --> 06:43:11.140
Salman Habeeb: LP for machine learning, like, okay.

3416
06:43:11.770 --> 06:43:14.990
Monal Kumar: Alright, so here it is not a part of any… yeah, sure. Thanks so much.

3417
06:43:14.990 --> 06:43:16.260
Salman Habeeb: Yeah, look forward.

3418
06:43:18.650 --> 06:43:23.210
Monal Kumar: Alright, and we have 9 people left.

3419
06:43:23.720 --> 06:43:25.280
Monal Kumar: Shantanu, you are next.

3420
06:43:31.140 --> 06:43:34.270
Monal Kumar: It's almost six and a half hour, guys. Yeah, hello.

3421
06:43:34.880 --> 06:43:36.029
Shantnu Singh: Yeah, yes, I…

3422
06:43:36.210 --> 06:43:44.859
Shantnu Singh: So, yeah, thank you, first chance you've given. So, I have completed a 13-month program from the IIT Bangalore.

3423
06:43:45.050 --> 06:43:54.249
Shantnu Singh: Which is organized from the upgrade, and, which was also very large and history-oriented program.

3424
06:43:54.990 --> 06:44:05.729
Shantnu Singh: And then now I'm doing the MS program, which is going to be started. So I would really appreciate your guidance to, select the elective. Like, I have mentors.

3425
06:44:05.730 --> 06:44:08.450
Monal Kumar: Your voice is muffling, it is not too clear, Shantra.

3426
06:44:09.270 --> 06:44:10.600
Shantnu Singh: Yeah, it's not clear.

3427
06:44:11.130 --> 06:44:13.019
Monal Kumar: It is not sharp, I mean…

3428
06:44:13.020 --> 06:44:16.299
Shantnu Singh: One second, sir, one second, give me.

3429
06:44:39.560 --> 06:44:43.140
Monal Kumar: Guys, whoever wants to drop off, you can drop off if you don't have any query.

3430
06:44:43.380 --> 06:44:59.820
Monal Kumar: And, for the Nash+, you will get mail. I'm not sure about the holiday, as other people are saying, but we'll check with the team, we'll check with the Krisha, and we'll let you know beforehand in the mail itself, alright? So, please check your mail before joining Wednesday Plus.

3431
06:45:00.840 --> 06:45:03.750
Monal Kumar: Right? You guys can drop off whoever is…

3432
06:45:04.220 --> 06:45:11.660
Monal Kumar: does not have any query, or does not want to listen to others. Okay, Ashantu, you can fix yours, but in the meantime, I can check with Arun Aga's changed.

3433
06:45:12.050 --> 06:45:12.900
Monal Kumar: Iron?

3434
06:45:14.540 --> 06:45:16.190
Monal Kumar: Sorry if I'm pronouncing your name wrong.

3435
06:45:16.610 --> 06:45:19.799
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: No, no, no worries. I'm a… I'm a audible monol.

3436
06:45:19.800 --> 06:45:21.130
Monal Kumar: You're audible, you're audible.

3437
06:45:21.130 --> 06:45:25.939
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: Yes, so hi Monal, and thank you for the time, I really appreciate that, your patience about it.

3438
06:45:26.050 --> 06:45:38.169
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: And, yes, so, without dragging a lot, I'm from Chennai. Coming to my background, I'm from Chennai, and I'm a pressure. Just recently, I got placed in a startup as a business analyst.

3439
06:45:38.340 --> 06:45:41.260
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: And I'll be joining the company on 14th of Jan.

3440
06:45:41.640 --> 06:45:43.169
Monal Kumar: And yes, sir.

3441
06:45:43.410 --> 06:45:45.319
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: And yes, my question is,

3442
06:45:45.510 --> 06:45:48.550
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: I came across this data science course, and

3443
06:45:49.080 --> 06:45:53.850
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: I already did a certification on data science and grade learning, where they covered till machine learning.

3444
06:45:54.060 --> 06:45:56.560
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: And further that day, they didn't cover anything.

3445
06:45:56.740 --> 06:46:02.669
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: And in this course, I have seen that you're going way advanced, more than machine learning also.

3446
06:46:02.670 --> 06:46:04.350
Monal Kumar: You're covering everything.

3447
06:46:04.350 --> 06:46:10.949
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: Yes, and that's great. And yes, my question for this is, do you be covering concepts on,

3448
06:46:11.100 --> 06:46:13.210
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: A time series forecasting…

3449
06:46:14.060 --> 06:46:21.269
Monal Kumar: series, we are not doing, because, as you can see, we have added a few modules in this particular version.

3450
06:46:21.270 --> 06:46:24.210
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: Yes, I saw the promotional value, haven't mentioned, yeah.

3451
06:46:24.570 --> 06:46:31.940
Monal Kumar: Within this one year of duration, which was in V1, we have added a lot of things of the agentic and drag which is not present in the V1.

3452
06:46:31.940 --> 06:46:45.539
Monal Kumar: And because we have added things, we also need to reduce, because we cannot make the course for 1.5 years, right? So time series is something, because if I talk about the requirement, time series is one of those requirements which is very specific.

3453
06:46:46.190 --> 06:46:47.630
Monal Kumar: All right? Which is.

3454
06:46:47.630 --> 06:46:50.449
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: Okay, so at least, will you be touch-pacing the topic, or…

3455
06:46:50.450 --> 06:47:05.010
Monal Kumar: I will not touch basing, but I will be touch basing things in such a way that if even a new concept like a time series comes in future, okay? If you understand what is a regression and classification numbers, how things work, how derivation works, and other things.

3456
06:47:05.010 --> 06:47:22.990
Monal Kumar: everything is kind of not too complex, alright? So time series, if you, later may be… if time permits, okay? If I am on time, or if I have more time, then I can touch at least the basics of it. If I don't have time, then, unfortunately, we have to skip it, because it is not a part of syllabus.

3457
06:47:23.050 --> 06:47:23.650
Monal Kumar: Yeah, I agree.

3458
06:47:23.650 --> 06:47:31.210
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: Yes, yes, I understand. And just one last question. Will you be covering, like, how to upload the projects in GitHub?

3459
06:47:31.550 --> 06:47:31.930
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3460
06:47:31.930 --> 06:47:32.399
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: We're doing that.

3461
06:47:32.400 --> 06:47:33.390
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3462
06:47:33.390 --> 06:47:37.560
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: Yes, so you'll teach us how to use GitHub, how to control the…

3463
06:47:37.560 --> 06:47:46.359
Monal Kumar: The teaching will be done within 2 hours. We are not here to be GitHub masters. We are here so that we can use GitHub and do things with it, alright?

3464
06:47:46.950 --> 06:47:49.770
Augusstin Arun Ulaganathan S: Okay, yeah, that's fine, yes. Thank you.

3465
06:47:49.770 --> 06:47:51.319
Monal Kumar: Yeah, thank you very much, Haru.

3466
06:47:52.550 --> 06:47:54.150
Monal Kumar: Alright, Shantanu?

3467
06:47:54.150 --> 06:47:56.270
Shantnu Singh: Yeah, yeah. Now my face is fine.

3468
06:47:56.650 --> 06:47:58.700
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, it is better.

3469
06:47:58.700 --> 06:48:13.089
Shantnu Singh: Yeah, yeah, thank you so much. So, so I have completed, recently 13-month program from the Triple IT Bangalore, which, conducted by Upgrade, and which was, more focused to theory-oriented only.

3470
06:48:13.090 --> 06:48:13.660
Monal Kumar: you know?

3471
06:48:13.660 --> 06:48:14.330
Shantnu Singh: Yeah, so…

3472
06:48:14.330 --> 06:48:15.350
Monal Kumar: already know.

3473
06:48:15.350 --> 06:48:35.489
Shantnu Singh: region that I am coming here, and my MS program from the Riverpun University, and going to be started for next 6 months. So, I would, like to take your advice. So, which, inductive areas would get focused, like predictive analytics, recommendation systems? I have written in questions,

3474
06:48:35.490 --> 06:48:36.630
Shantnu Singh: box also

3475
06:48:36.630 --> 06:48:43.879
Shantnu Singh: So, 6th, 7th subject, even because I already paid, so I have to do that, this, MS degree. So, I want to take.

3476
06:48:43.880 --> 06:48:53.379
Monal Kumar: See, if you take my advice on something that is too big of a decision, that is to be taken by some mentor, okay, what I would suggest is.

3477
06:48:53.410 --> 06:49:09.360
Monal Kumar: whatever family subjects are there, okay? Because subject is… you are only going to learn that. After that, you are not going to focus on a particular subject when it's time for job, right? You are not going to get job just for recommendation system. You're going to get job for a data scientist and an engineer, yes?

3478
06:49:09.580 --> 06:49:10.400
Shantnu Singh: Yes.

3479
06:49:10.400 --> 06:49:16.160
Monal Kumar: So, because it is subject, I will… I'm not going to… what I will do is, I will help you

3480
06:49:16.180 --> 06:49:29.000
Monal Kumar: just plan how to decide it. I'm not going to decide it for you. If you don't like it, then tomorrow you will say, sir, you have mentioned that now there is no scope. So I will suggest, on that seventh subject, do a little bit of homework in YouTube. Try to learn

3481
06:49:29.000 --> 06:49:39.000
Monal Kumar: what recommendation systems do? Are there any new research, or all the things are already done? Because at the end, you're also going to create research also, right? You have to write that paper.

3482
06:49:39.860 --> 06:49:40.890
Shantnu Singh: Yes, yes.

3483
06:49:40.890 --> 06:49:54.159
Monal Kumar: So, try to find a field where there are a lot of research going on, and there is a space for more research. If all the things are already solved, it's like doing a research in, LLMs. It is very tough.

3484
06:49:54.640 --> 06:50:06.199
Monal Kumar: To do research in Netherlands, you have to… you should know how to code Netherlands, to do all those research, compare with other things, but it is because of it is academics, do something where you can do it easily and can also focus on the job.

3485
06:50:06.720 --> 06:50:07.939
Monal Kumar: Are you getting my point?

3486
06:50:07.940 --> 06:50:08.800
Shantnu Singh: Yes, yes, yes.

3487
06:50:08.800 --> 06:50:12.699
Monal Kumar: where there is a scope to do research easily. So, focus on that.

3488
06:50:12.900 --> 06:50:22.050
Monal Kumar: On that 7, do some homework, and try to eliminate. Do the elimination method, try to eliminate things which you don't like, and then do the homework on the last part.

3489
06:50:22.630 --> 06:50:23.410
Monal Kumar: Alright?

3490
06:50:23.690 --> 06:50:24.900
Shantnu Singh: Okay, okay.

3491
06:50:24.900 --> 06:50:26.679
Monal Kumar: Thank you. Yeah, yeah, you're welcome.

3492
06:50:28.190 --> 06:50:31.680
Monal Kumar: Alright, then we have, gaurav?

3493
06:50:32.070 --> 06:50:35.549
Monal Kumar: After Gaurav, we have Suchaka. The first Gaurav, then Sujaka.

3494
06:50:35.700 --> 06:50:36.700
Monal Kumar: Hey, Gaurav.

3495
06:50:36.700 --> 06:50:40.600
GauravGohil: Hey, hi Munal. Hello. Hello. My voice is audible.

3496
06:50:40.600 --> 06:50:41.710
Monal Kumar: Yes, of course, this article.

3497
06:50:41.710 --> 06:50:45.049
GauravGohil: Yeah, thank you so much for your patience and time.

3498
06:50:46.490 --> 06:50:58.139
GauravGohil: And, I want, your guidance, regarding my carrier gap. So, in the beginning, I have worked for around 6 years in mobile, Android application development.

3499
06:50:58.140 --> 06:51:09.040
GauravGohil: And then I have worked around 2 years in distributed ledger technology application development, and then I got layoff in, like, beginning of 24, 2024.

3500
06:51:09.040 --> 06:51:24.230
GauravGohil: Then, luckily, I got a job in some, social media for a YouTuber, so I've been working with him for the past 2 years for video editing, content creation, and managing the social media handles.

3501
06:51:24.540 --> 06:51:25.200
Monal Kumar: Yes?

3502
06:51:25.200 --> 06:51:28.150
GauravGohil: So, now I want to join the IT.

3503
06:51:28.300 --> 06:51:41.299
GauravGohil: With the help of AI. So, I've been following Chris for a very long time, and I wanted to join this AI course last year, but I could not. So, this year, I joined it.

3504
06:51:41.590 --> 06:51:48.750
GauravGohil: So, this 2 years gap that I have, will that be… create a problem in IT, if I.

3505
06:51:48.750 --> 06:51:50.470
Monal Kumar: create a problem.

3506
06:51:50.470 --> 06:51:50.910
GauravGohil: Huh.

3507
06:51:50.910 --> 06:51:53.859
Monal Kumar: third problem for MNCs.

3508
06:51:53.880 --> 06:52:06.380
Monal Kumar: Okay? MNCs might ask you what you were doing, and then if you say, I was doing… they might not find you relevant, because you are not data scientist yet, alright? So what you can do…

3509
06:52:06.380 --> 06:52:21.960
Monal Kumar: MSS is not the only companies. There are a lot of startups, right? And the startups accepts every people. Even if you're not from BTEC, MTech, even if you have done… even if you have not done graduation, MSS will give you opportunity, if you know the skills.

3510
06:52:22.490 --> 06:52:23.760
Monal Kumar: Are you… are you clear?

3511
06:52:23.760 --> 06:52:25.220
GauravGohil: Yes, yes, clear.

3512
06:52:25.220 --> 06:52:30.070
Monal Kumar: Okay, so it is very doable that if you don't have the skills,

3513
06:52:30.730 --> 06:52:49.099
Monal Kumar: It is hard. So I would suggest you to work very hard, try to find exactly what field you are working, because in… there are a number of possibilities. There is one startup which I've heard which is working on games, okay, which is working on creating short videos from games using computer vision.

3514
06:52:49.100 --> 06:53:00.949
Monal Kumar: Computer vision is a part of AI, alright? So, they create those things from there. So, if you like video editing, try to create some projects on that. If you like something else, do end number of things until and unless you get the job.

3515
06:53:01.440 --> 06:53:13.189
Monal Kumar: Try startups. And once you have a tag of AI engineer or something, even if you have a video… I personally know my friend who was a video editor, then he's currently a data scientist.

3516
06:53:14.330 --> 06:53:16.050
GauravGohil: Okay, nice.

3517
06:53:16.050 --> 06:53:22.470
Monal Kumar: But it has been, like, 4 years now. So, he's pretty good at his job right now. So you also have to be good at it.

3518
06:53:23.250 --> 06:53:24.590
GauravGohil: Yeah, sure, definitely.

3519
06:53:24.590 --> 06:53:32.230
Monal Kumar: Try to get as much internship as possible. Internship will break your, internship will break your… this flow that you are having, your editing the flow.

3520
06:53:32.790 --> 06:53:33.640
Monal Kumar: Alright?

3521
06:53:33.640 --> 06:53:34.630
GauravGohil: Yeah, understood.

3522
06:53:34.630 --> 06:53:47.669
Monal Kumar: That, until and unless you are getting, you're getting paid, because I know that we all have responsibilities to do. Until and unless you have that sorted out, don't leave your responsibility… don't leave the place where you are able to fulfill your responsibility.

3523
06:53:48.160 --> 06:53:48.590
GauravGohil: Yes.

3524
06:53:48.590 --> 06:53:51.460
Monal Kumar: Good, but in the meantime, do something else. Alright, Gaurav?

3525
06:53:51.460 --> 06:53:54.620
GauravGohil: Yes, sure. Definitely, I will do. Thank you so much, Mael.

3526
06:53:54.620 --> 06:53:55.619
Monal Kumar: Yeah, thank you.

3527
06:53:56.690 --> 06:53:57.970
Monal Kumar: Alright…

3528
06:53:59.120 --> 06:54:00.290
sujata: Sujata?

3529
06:54:00.530 --> 06:54:02.819
sujata: Yeah, hi, this is Raji Hu. Actually, I have joined…

3530
06:54:02.820 --> 06:54:03.170
Monal Kumar: Hands.

3531
06:54:03.170 --> 06:54:15.480
sujata: wife's account. Yeah. Hi, Monal, I just wanted to say big thanks to you, the way you have handled last six and a half hours. I think I am at good place.

3532
06:54:15.960 --> 06:54:20.060
sujata: And I'm really, looking forward

3533
06:54:20.400 --> 06:54:28.879
sujata: To go through this, study. I'm based in UK, so start time is around 3.30am.

3534
06:54:29.260 --> 06:54:29.800
Monal Kumar: Oh!

3535
06:54:30.090 --> 06:54:38.009
sujata: Yeah, but this first session has given me, enough region to wake up at 3.30 and join your live session.

3536
06:54:38.010 --> 06:54:45.439
Monal Kumar: really, like, you're doing really awesome. 3.30 AM, I cannot even think, but you're doing it, so, yes.

3537
06:54:45.440 --> 06:54:51.810
sujata: Yeah, just wanted to say thanks to you, and maybe questions will come once you will start learning.

3538
06:54:51.810 --> 06:54:54.489
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, I'm ready for that. Yeah.

3539
06:54:54.490 --> 06:54:59.440
sujata: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for saying, Sujava. Sorry, Ravi. Yeah, yeah, thank you.

3540
06:54:59.440 --> 06:55:00.419
Monal Kumar: Thank you, thank you.

3541
06:55:04.030 --> 06:55:08.470
Monal Kumar: Alright, then we have… Tandeep?

3542
06:55:10.700 --> 06:55:11.800
Monal Kumar: Hey, Sandeep?

3543
06:55:12.800 --> 06:55:13.740
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: I'm on a…

3544
06:55:14.280 --> 06:55:14.649
Monal Kumar: How are you?

3545
06:55:14.650 --> 06:55:16.600
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: We'll have lunch after this.

3546
06:55:16.600 --> 06:55:19.579
Monal Kumar: Yeah, yeah, I even have lunch after this. Yes.

3547
06:55:19.580 --> 06:55:29.329
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: So, I just wanted to check on, after we become an AI engineer, what are the next roles? Do we become senior AI engineer, AI architect?

3548
06:55:29.770 --> 06:55:30.529
Monal Kumar: He's a good guy.

3549
06:55:30.530 --> 06:55:37.170
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: any… Normal software architect and AI architect, easy having a… .

3550
06:55:37.170 --> 06:55:45.919
Monal Kumar: there is nothing like an AI architect, okay? An architect job is to also handle the AI part of it, because for an architect.

3551
06:55:46.160 --> 06:55:53.300
Monal Kumar: what exactly going behind that module concerns less, and what is their responsibility? More is to

3552
06:55:53.760 --> 06:56:12.660
Monal Kumar: how are we going to handle all of this, requests and all of those things, designing part with the lowest latency and other things, that is a part of architect, okay? But inside part of it, the AI person is going to deal with it. It can be a lead person, it can be a senior AI engineer, so those persons will be handling those.

3553
06:56:13.380 --> 06:56:21.159
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Okay. Yep. So, do we need to learn, for the system design and data struct… Design pattern?

3554
06:56:21.380 --> 06:56:24.429
Monal Kumar: The higher your skills are, the more your pay is, so…

3555
06:56:24.430 --> 06:56:37.010
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Yeah, because currently I work as a Salesforce architect, and Salesforce itself have their own AI products, like Einstein and all, but we can have… use this Salesforce…

3556
06:56:37.010 --> 06:56:40.130
Monal Kumar: use it, we cannot… we don't know what is going on behind them.

3557
06:56:40.270 --> 06:56:47.620
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Yeah, exactly. So we can use Salesforce APIs to fetch the data from there, and build our own, agent decay model, something…

3558
06:56:47.810 --> 06:56:49.420
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Like that with this course, right?

3559
06:56:49.600 --> 06:56:50.850
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes, yes.

3560
06:56:51.260 --> 06:57:06.229
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: And, some more questions, like, we also have some, improvements in the quantum computing field in machine learning, so once we, gain this knowledge, and if that gains more, speed, then do we need to upgrade again to that quantum computing?

3561
06:57:06.510 --> 06:57:07.190
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Wanted.

3562
06:57:07.190 --> 06:57:17.749
Monal Kumar: computing is something that is meant for researchers, and content computing logic itself is different. Here, our computer runs 0-1. Contact computer does not work just with 01.

3563
06:57:17.770 --> 06:57:35.090
Monal Kumar: So, for now, we are not researchers, and if there is a possibility for you to become the real researcher scientist who knows all those mathematics and other things, then it is required. For us, it is not required. For developers, there will always be a wrapper so that we can develop things instead of focusing.

3564
06:57:35.090 --> 06:57:38.920
Monal Kumar: Right now, if you say operating system, do you know the code of operating system?

3565
06:57:38.930 --> 06:57:39.700
Monal Kumar: No.

3566
06:57:40.490 --> 06:57:43.620
Monal Kumar: It is made for us so that we can do more work on top of it.

3567
06:57:43.630 --> 06:58:00.799
Monal Kumar: So quantum computing will be there, but it will only be used a lot when there is a wrapper on top of it, which we can use. Maybe there can be a framework where, with Python, we can communicate… I think there is already a framework which we can communicate with the quantum computers, we can write code, but we are not going to deal with the internal stuff.

3568
06:58:01.400 --> 06:58:02.230
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Okay.

3569
06:58:02.490 --> 06:58:13.030
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: And one more question, is, so we already have a lot of models that are available, LLMs that are available, so where do you see more opportunities? Is it, using the LLMs?

3570
06:58:13.030 --> 06:58:15.170
Monal Kumar: LLMs, using LLMs. We don't create.

3571
06:58:15.170 --> 06:58:15.790
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: popular lens.

3572
06:58:16.190 --> 06:58:23.540
Monal Kumar: Yeah, we don't get funding to create our own LLMs to do the experimentation, but using those LLMs, you can create a lot of awesome things.

3573
06:58:23.910 --> 06:58:32.799
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Yeah, and for using LMs, we don't… we need to have credits, right? So, as part of this course, we need to buy some credits for using their APIs.

3574
06:58:32.800 --> 06:58:49.730
Monal Kumar: only a very small amount, or mentor is going to do that. You can just see and just learn. No need to buy your own, right? It is totally up to us whether we want to do the experimentation of our own. Mentor is going to do it. If you're fine with that, if you want to do your own experimentation, then maybe you need to do that.

3575
06:58:49.760 --> 06:58:54.410
Monal Kumar: But we will try to use as much as retire or low-cost as possible.

3576
06:58:55.260 --> 06:59:01.060
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Okay, okay. And, you suggest to have DSA if you want to go into big companies, along with that?

3577
06:59:01.060 --> 06:59:03.060
Monal Kumar: That is, that is must. That is must.

3578
06:59:03.060 --> 06:59:04.429
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Yes, sir, and yeah, okay.

3579
06:59:04.430 --> 06:59:14.610
Monal Kumar: Even if you don't know AI, if you know just DSA, you can cover first round. If you know… if you're the master of AI and you don't know DSA, you cannot… you cannot go into the company.

3580
06:59:14.750 --> 06:59:16.140
Monal Kumar: Because that is the first round.

3581
06:59:16.330 --> 06:59:16.990
Monal Kumar: Okay.

3582
06:59:16.990 --> 06:59:18.110
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Yeah, got it.

3583
06:59:18.340 --> 06:59:22.379
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: And what are the industries that we can apply, like, current industries?

3584
06:59:22.950 --> 06:59:23.810
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: green.

3585
06:59:23.810 --> 06:59:28.869
Monal Kumar: Every industry, yes. If they have requirement, you have the skill, you will get hired.

3586
06:59:29.610 --> 06:59:30.130
Kalavendi, Phaneendra Sandeep /IN Opella: Okay.

3587
06:59:30.130 --> 06:59:33.320
Monal Kumar: Thank you so much for your patience. Thank you. Yeah, thank you.

3588
06:59:34.090 --> 06:59:37.470
Monal Kumar: And then, we have different Sunday.

3589
06:59:38.090 --> 06:59:39.190
Monal Kumar: Hey, Sandeep!

3590
06:59:41.650 --> 06:59:42.480
Sandeep Paladugu: Can you hear me?

3591
06:59:42.890 --> 06:59:43.929
Monal Kumar: Yeah, I can hear you.

3592
06:59:44.450 --> 06:59:45.460
Sandeep Paladugu: Good afternoon.

3593
06:59:45.580 --> 06:59:46.910
Sandeep Paladugu: Thanks for your time.

3594
06:59:47.010 --> 06:59:54.530
Sandeep Paladugu: So, before I start, Mona, let me give my background, actually. I'm into IT industry from last 16 years.

3595
06:59:54.600 --> 07:00:07.340
Sandeep Paladugu: But, from last 5 years, I'll be… I am in engineering manager role. I can say I worked on different, different tech stacks, like .NET, Pega, Mainframe, and all those sort of things.

3596
07:00:07.340 --> 07:00:23.570
Sandeep Paladugu: But I can say, I am not master of anything, I can tell you openly, like, I'm not good at… So right now, from last 5 years, I'm managing a team. I can say 30% of coding I'm doing, and 70% is, like, people management.

3597
07:00:23.610 --> 07:00:42.769
Sandeep Paladugu: Now, based on all the previous discussions, whatever you are doing, I feel like I need to start from scratch, understand everything, and switch over to some different career in data science. So that's what I am thinking, but I just want to make sure from you to understand, like, whether that…

3598
07:00:42.770 --> 07:00:53.939
Monal Kumar: do this, as well as, try to look in the industry, because you're already managing people, right? Next stage in your career is going to be,

3599
07:00:53.990 --> 07:01:03.530
Monal Kumar: going to be someone who will also be taking decisions, right? Because there… there is obviously someone who's on top of it. What is that position? If you know that, Sandeep?

3600
07:01:03.680 --> 07:01:04.870
Sandeep Paladugu: Senior Manager.

3601
07:01:04.870 --> 07:01:12.719
Monal Kumar: Senior Manager. So, senior manager is going to also… the expectation is also going to have some ideas and have them implemented, right?

3602
07:01:12.920 --> 07:01:27.210
Monal Kumar: So, you also need to think in terms of, how can I bring more ideas that are, that have AI in them, because that is what business requires, right? Business is very fancy when the AI world comes in.

3603
07:01:27.870 --> 07:01:34.850
Monal Kumar: So, think of the problem statement, what AI solves, what we can do, and try to also prepare yourself in terms of that.

3604
07:01:35.210 --> 07:01:52.259
Monal Kumar: what exactly others are doing? Can I also pitch it and make my team, make it… just… just make it done with my… with the help of my team, and get… and get to the next stage in my career? So also think in terms of that direction, because that will help you as a manager to go to the next position.

3605
07:01:52.440 --> 07:01:53.080
Monal Kumar: Sounded.

3606
07:01:53.080 --> 07:02:02.309
Sandeep Paladugu: Okay, okay, and if I think an alternate career, so can I have an architect role too? I mean, can I switch over to architect role?

3607
07:02:02.310 --> 07:02:20.119
Monal Kumar: You can, you can, you can go to the architect, but for an architect, as I mentioned, think that what are the different… architect also requires a little bit of data engineering, it also requires, now, the concurrency Java and other modularity, message queues, a lot of different things, right?

3608
07:02:20.120 --> 07:02:29.750
Monal Kumar: But if you have not heard any of it, maybe it is high time that you start reading about those, at least. So, within one year or two years, you can target those, because

3609
07:02:29.860 --> 07:02:38.879
Monal Kumar: if you want to go into the senior and pitch things, I would not suggest you to do, if you get a job position tomorrow, join that as a senior manager, because you're not ready internally.

3610
07:02:39.350 --> 07:02:40.200
Sandeep Paladugu: Yeah.

3611
07:02:40.200 --> 07:02:59.430
Monal Kumar: Right? So, and don't wait too long, 5 years that I will be ready. You have to be ready, give yourself some time, give yourself some goal that I will be doing that, but everything should be noted down that what exactly I have to do. If you're a fo… if you have to be architect, then don't go like a senior manager. Architect job is someone else.

3612
07:02:59.870 --> 07:03:01.400
Sandeep Paladugu: Okay, okay, go.

3613
07:03:01.400 --> 07:03:05.100
Monal Kumar: Plan things out, plan things out, and then move in that direction.

3614
07:03:05.350 --> 07:03:11.260
Monal Kumar: But this whole course will give you the base that, okay, this is what happens in AI.

3615
07:03:12.220 --> 07:03:17.880
Sandeep Paladugu: Yeah, sure. And that's a good thing to start from the base and go into an advanced level, because…

3616
07:03:17.880 --> 07:03:26.580
Monal Kumar: give you confidence that, no one can be able to say that you don't know coding, as you mentioned, right? You are not good at currently what is the current skill set.

3617
07:03:27.030 --> 07:03:27.370
Sandeep Paladugu: Hmm.

3618
07:03:27.370 --> 07:03:31.220
Monal Kumar: later stage, you will not feel that, I don't know things. I know things.

3619
07:03:31.360 --> 07:03:44.100
Monal Kumar: But I am, What should I say? But currently, I don't want to write the code, because I do have a lot of things to manage, a lot of things to plan, other things, right? That can help you as well.

3620
07:03:44.420 --> 07:03:49.159
Sandeep Paladugu: because currently I'm leading a ML team, and I'm also working on a GenA project, and all the.

3621
07:03:49.160 --> 07:03:49.580
Monal Kumar: too much.

3622
07:03:49.580 --> 07:04:02.730
Sandeep Paladugu: I'm doing, but I'm not having that confidence, and I'm also not actually pitching into their systems, like, what exactly they are doing and all, but I'm just driving the ideas, and I'm doing the things.

3623
07:04:03.070 --> 07:04:04.010
Sandeep Paladugu: Not exactly.

3624
07:04:04.010 --> 07:04:07.239
Monal Kumar: What exactly is going on in the firing game in the companies, right?

3625
07:04:07.240 --> 07:04:08.109
Sandeep Paladugu: Yes, sir, that's,

3626
07:04:08.110 --> 07:04:12.390
Monal Kumar: job managers are also expected to use LLM to help the team.

3627
07:04:13.270 --> 07:04:17.660
Monal Kumar: is generating something and you're not confident what ailing is doing, then how are you going to help the team also, right?

3628
07:04:18.030 --> 07:04:20.389
Monal Kumar: So at least you will have better chances.

3629
07:04:20.550 --> 07:04:21.310
Monal Kumar: Then right now.

3630
07:04:21.310 --> 07:04:26.479
Sandeep Paladugu: Because nowadays, they are using a lot of different tools to track our GitHub commits and everything.

3631
07:04:26.480 --> 07:04:27.240
Monal Kumar: No, yes, yes.

3632
07:04:27.240 --> 07:04:33.369
Sandeep Paladugu: I'm making out the metrics, and I can see my directors are getting fired very soon because of.

3633
07:04:33.370 --> 07:04:34.450
Monal Kumar: Yeah, okay.

3634
07:04:34.450 --> 07:04:36.490
Sandeep Paladugu: So that's where I thought, like.

3635
07:04:36.490 --> 07:04:40.699
Monal Kumar: Yeah, this is the item that you're doing it, but do a lot of things parallel, alright?

3636
07:04:41.050 --> 07:04:57.469
Sandeep Paladugu: Sure, thank you. Thanks, Munda. And also, one more suggestion, even my wife want to start, enroll this course, and she'll be enrolling, tomorrow or so, but she is completely a mainframe background resource, and, she does a, from legacy systems and all, and,

3637
07:04:57.750 --> 07:05:07.689
Monal Kumar: As I'll be teaching it from the very base. It's totally up to, you guys' discussion that, what is our next target?

3638
07:05:08.580 --> 07:05:09.060
Sandeep Paladugu: Okay.

3639
07:05:09.060 --> 07:05:21.889
Monal Kumar: Right? I'm teaching data science. My goal here is to teach everyone here. But if you guys can plan your targets, and this fits in your target, then yes, join it, learn it, and then complete your target.

3640
07:05:22.220 --> 07:05:30.690
Sandeep Paladugu: Sure, sure. Yeah, thank you. Thanks, Manal. And I also learned one more thing is, like, having patients like you should be there in the data sense, too.

3641
07:05:31.270 --> 07:05:32.639
Sandeep Paladugu: Excel, I feel.

3642
07:05:32.740 --> 07:05:38.420
Monal Kumar: Yes, see, this is something which I'm also learning. And yes, thank you very much for complimenting it.

3643
07:05:38.580 --> 07:05:40.100
Sandeep Paladugu: Yes?

3644
07:05:40.800 --> 07:05:41.860
Monal Kumar: Thanks, Andrew.

3645
07:05:41.860 --> 07:05:43.229
Sandeep Paladugu: Thanks, thank you.

3646
07:05:44.760 --> 07:05:48.550
Monal Kumar: Alright, then we have Arnius.

3647
07:05:49.720 --> 07:05:52.820
Monal Kumar: Sorry if I'm not pronouncing your name correctly, Hani, yes?

3648
07:05:54.160 --> 07:05:55.960
anyis: Hello? Can you hear me?

3649
07:05:56.200 --> 07:05:57.740
Monal Kumar: I can hear you, yes?

3650
07:05:57.740 --> 07:05:58.330
anyis: Yep.

3651
07:05:58.690 --> 07:06:05.350
anyis: He's a… I'm a beginner, so I… Want to know with the curriculum.

3652
07:06:06.480 --> 07:06:09.789
anyis: If I finish this program, what can I do?

3653
07:06:10.850 --> 07:06:18.670
Monal Kumar: As I mentioned to other people, Annie, that if you finish this course, what you should target is, you should target one goal.

3654
07:06:18.890 --> 07:06:32.449
Monal Kumar: This course will be one of those things which will help you achieve your target, but after this course, or in parallel to this course, you should also work hard, learn more things, create projects, do things, which company requires.

3655
07:06:33.610 --> 07:06:35.470
Monal Kumar: Where are you located, Aniz?

3656
07:06:36.870 --> 07:06:38.240
anyis: where I'm located.

3657
07:06:38.650 --> 07:06:40.680
Monal Kumar: Yes, where are you located? Yes.

3658
07:06:40.680 --> 07:06:43.470
anyis: I'm located in Switzerland.

3659
07:06:43.760 --> 07:06:52.799
Monal Kumar: Suzerland, alright? So, based on Switzerland requirement, this course is going to give you the main foundations and skills to complete a job.

3660
07:06:52.970 --> 07:07:04.049
Monal Kumar: Now, check in job posting for the fresher positions and others. In Switzerland, what exactly they require. If they require certain things as well, you need to add those, and learn those parallelly as well.

3661
07:07:04.150 --> 07:07:17.939
Monal Kumar: So, this course will give you a foundation, but will it give you a job? It totally depends on your demographic, and currently you're in Switzerland. Check what exactly they require. Do they require more things? Do they require a fresher to also handle the project?

3662
07:07:17.940 --> 07:07:26.210
Monal Kumar: So, based on that, it will give you more clarity. But this will give you skills to create machine learning, deep learning, WAG agent AI projects.

3663
07:07:27.830 --> 07:07:29.550
anyis: Okay, so… Yeah.

3664
07:07:29.710 --> 07:07:32.799
anyis: And also, please, during the…

3665
07:07:33.190 --> 07:07:39.620
anyis: lectures. During the lesson, will we be having a project, you know?

3666
07:07:39.990 --> 07:07:59.560
Monal Kumar: We will have projects. We will have projects, but not for each lecture. Once a big chunk of module is completed, let's suppose a module requires Python, database, and other things, that will create a single project. Machine learning is completed, then we will add Python plus machine learning as a project. So, based on multiple modules, we will create a single project, alright?

3667
07:08:00.040 --> 07:08:01.769
anyis: Yeah, okay, so, yeah.

3668
07:08:01.860 --> 07:08:05.769
Monal Kumar: Yes. So, yeah, it's good, yeah. It's a combination of,

3669
07:08:05.770 --> 07:08:08.059
anyis: Both theory and practice, yeah.

3670
07:08:08.060 --> 07:08:08.880
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

3671
07:08:08.880 --> 07:08:09.540
anyis: Yeah.

3672
07:08:09.740 --> 07:08:19.989
Monal Kumar: Every class will be pec… every coding class will be concept plus practical, and every… after a bunch of models is completed, we will also see project practical. So, we have a lot of practicals.

3673
07:08:21.040 --> 07:08:28.989
anyis: And also, please, like, today, do we have an election today? Because it's like, I didn't…

3674
07:08:28.990 --> 07:08:36.399
Monal Kumar: No, no, no. Today, it is just induction. It is just about knowing each other, knowing, understanding doubts, clearing doubts, that's all.

3675
07:08:37.710 --> 07:08:40.140
anyis: Okay, because I was thinking that I missed out.

3676
07:08:40.140 --> 07:08:41.770
Monal Kumar: No, no, you didn't miss out on anything.

3677
07:08:42.050 --> 07:08:47.690
anyis: Yes. Okay, then also, these lessons

3678
07:08:47.800 --> 07:08:53.760
anyis: If we start next week on Wednesday, We can… the recalling…

3679
07:08:53.990 --> 07:08:57.210
anyis: it's on the website, we can…

3680
07:08:57.630 --> 07:08:58.480
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3681
07:08:58.940 --> 07:09:02.729
anyis: Recording will be on the website, and… Will be uploaded on the web?

3682
07:09:02.810 --> 07:09:08.230
Monal Kumar: Yes, tomorrow also you will be able to see, this class recording as well in your dashboard.

3683
07:09:08.750 --> 07:09:14.710
anyis: Very good. Then also, there… will there be also a… a reading material.

3684
07:09:15.200 --> 07:09:16.070
anyis: Yay. Yes.

3685
07:09:16.490 --> 07:09:34.870
Monal Kumar: So whenever I'm going to teach you something, I'm going to write those things in my notepad, okay, just like I was drawing on my notepad, and whatever code I'm writing, that will also be present in your resource section, which I will be showing you later. Alright? So, you will get the same code which I'm writing, you will get the same thing which I'm writing as the PDF as well.

3686
07:09:35.910 --> 07:09:42.480
anyis: So, we will be getting both the video recording and the PDF.

3687
07:09:42.480 --> 07:09:43.160
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3688
07:09:43.300 --> 07:09:45.159
anyis: Written material PDF.

3689
07:09:45.160 --> 07:09:45.550
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3690
07:09:45.550 --> 07:09:47.569
anyis: So, we can read both.

3691
07:09:47.920 --> 07:09:49.119
Monal Kumar: Yes, yes.

3692
07:09:50.140 --> 07:09:52.890
anyis: Then also, would there be any textbook?

3693
07:09:53.120 --> 07:09:55.079
anyis: We will read for December.

3694
07:09:55.080 --> 07:10:09.340
Monal Kumar: I will suggest to not go for books, because books will… books tend to be a little bit slower. It totally depends on who is reading the book, but I personally think that we go more deeper than the books, and yes.

3695
07:10:10.070 --> 07:10:14.169
Monal Kumar: So you will have more in-depth understanding of each topic than the books.

3696
07:10:16.270 --> 07:10:19.870
anyis: Wow. Dan, it's great, yeah, it's… yeah.

3697
07:10:20.100 --> 07:10:21.540
anyis: Yeah, it's great, yeah.

3698
07:10:21.820 --> 07:10:22.640
anyis: Yeah.

3699
07:10:23.330 --> 07:10:25.370
anyis: Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate it.

3700
07:10:25.370 --> 07:10:28.679
Monal Kumar: Thank you. Thank you very much, Andres. Thank you. We'll see you next time.

3701
07:10:29.020 --> 07:10:30.179
anyis: Yeah, thanks, man.

3702
07:10:32.180 --> 07:10:35.099
Monal Kumar: Alright, Dan, we have only…

3703
07:10:35.270 --> 07:10:41.030
Monal Kumar: 3 people, guys, only last… last two people, that's all, alright? Abhay. Abhay is next.

3704
07:10:41.280 --> 07:10:44.490
Monal Kumar: And… Ratna Jyoti is last.

3705
07:10:44.890 --> 07:10:47.089
Abhay Rai: Hello, Monolan, am I audible?

3706
07:10:47.090 --> 07:10:48.260
Monal Kumar: Yes, I've got your audiobook.

3707
07:10:48.520 --> 07:10:54.880
Abhay Rai: Yeah, so I have two doubts, and the first one is, can we get the timeline of the course, like.

3708
07:10:54.880 --> 07:10:59.220
Monal Kumar: Abeh, this is… yeah, okay, I can directly answer. I already know what question you're asking.

3709
07:10:59.220 --> 07:10:59.759
Abhay Rai: Yeah, yeah.

3710
07:10:59.760 --> 07:11:10.780
Monal Kumar: In the previous batch also, people were asking about the timeline, but I will tell you what happens. In a particular class, if a topic comes, because there is a combination of non-tech and tech people, right?

3711
07:11:10.780 --> 07:11:21.520
Monal Kumar: sometimes they might ask a lot of doubt, or they are very overwhelmed. Then me, personally, as a mentor, I don't want to stretch the class and teach more things. If people are already overwhelmed, they will not learn.

3712
07:11:21.520 --> 07:11:35.869
Monal Kumar: Right? They will not be able to learn. If they're not able to learn, they will lose something, right? So, the flexibility changes a bit. So, what you can do, if you want to understand estimate time, you can check the previous… you already had the V1, right?

3713
07:11:36.020 --> 07:11:36.700
Abhay Rai: Yeah, yeah.

3714
07:11:36.840 --> 07:11:40.990
Monal Kumar: In the V1, when we are doing some Python, the topics is also written there.

3715
07:11:41.990 --> 07:11:42.370
Abhay Rai: Yeah.

3716
07:11:42.370 --> 07:11:55.150
Monal Kumar: Or you can just check what is going on, and then you will estimate that Python… Python was estimated to 1.5 months, and it might be done, because this is the batch, too. I already have all the notes and other things, so all I have to do is

3717
07:11:55.150 --> 07:12:04.749
Monal Kumar: teach you again. I don't have to teach you from the very, very zero. Batch one was the zero. Now I don't have the zero, right? So this one will be faster than before. The estimate will be lower than before.

3718
07:12:04.960 --> 07:12:05.730
Monal Kumar: Alright, Amen?

3719
07:12:05.730 --> 07:12:14.320
Abhay Rai: Like, I want to know that, till the deep learning part, like, how much long it will take to complete deep learning?

3720
07:12:14.320 --> 07:12:21.030
Monal Kumar: Previously, it took around, it will take around 6 months, Abeh, till deep learning.

3721
07:12:21.290 --> 07:12:27.189
Monal Kumar: They'll… from the day, we will start the deep learning. Deep learning day one will be after 6 months.

3722
07:12:27.570 --> 07:12:28.409
Monal Kumar: This is the estimate.

3723
07:12:29.470 --> 07:12:45.459
Abhay Rai: And my second, doubt was, like, after the module is completed, like, just say the Python is completed, or machine learning is completed, or a new library is completed, are you going to give some, like, interview-related material so that we can.

3724
07:12:45.460 --> 07:12:46.180
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3725
07:12:46.380 --> 07:13:02.419
Monal Kumar: Yes, see, we all mentors, what we do, sometimes, if we don't have time, or if you want to give more content, even Mayank and Sunny also creates their YouTube and posts new things there, alright? We will give you interview questions. Interview questions, we already have it, we just,

3726
07:13:02.940 --> 07:13:16.409
Monal Kumar: what is there in interview question? Whatever we are asking, we can give you. In one topic, we can get one question, two questions, that's all, right? But whatever you feel like is not a part of the syllabus, and you guys should have it, what we will do, we will also teach it, because in,

3727
07:13:16.730 --> 07:13:28.519
Monal Kumar: this is the thing which we have… the syllabus is the utmost priority. In parallel, if you need something, even I can post something, Sunny will post something, my answer will post something, and we will keep on learning and expanding and…

3728
07:13:28.670 --> 07:13:30.080
Monal Kumar: This direction as well.

3729
07:13:30.230 --> 07:13:34.610
Monal Kumar: Alright, so don't worry about it. We will provide the material which will require you to get a job, alright?

3730
07:13:35.530 --> 07:13:37.690
Abhay Rai: So, that's all the questions I have. Thank you.

3731
07:13:37.690 --> 07:13:39.770
Monal Kumar: You're welcome. Thank you very much.

3732
07:13:40.700 --> 07:13:44.270
Monal Kumar: Alright, then, Ratna Jyoti, you are next.

3733
07:13:45.190 --> 07:13:46.710
Ratnajyothi: Hi, Mona.

3734
07:13:46.710 --> 07:13:47.890
Monal Kumar: Hello, Hero Khati.

3735
07:13:48.100 --> 07:13:59.879
Ratnajyothi: Yeah, can you show me previous patch recordings in the dashboard? Under the courses tab, I couldn't get… that's where… can you show me once…

3736
07:14:00.940 --> 07:14:02.609
Monal Kumar: that, just a bit.

3737
07:14:04.820 --> 07:14:07.479
Monal Kumar: It is not under your courses.

3738
07:14:08.800 --> 07:14:10.529
Ratnajyothi: Yeah, I couldn't find…

3739
07:14:10.820 --> 07:14:13.899
Monal Kumar: You will not find under your courses. Are you able to see courses?

3740
07:14:13.900 --> 07:14:14.950
Ratnajyothi: Yeah, okay.

3741
07:14:14.950 --> 07:14:18.960
Monal Kumar: In courses, you will see only 2 courses if you've enrolled for Ultimate Data Science 2.

3742
07:14:19.330 --> 07:14:21.000
Ratnajyothi: Yeah, that one, yeah…

3743
07:14:21.000 --> 07:14:25.240
Monal Kumar: You will see that one, and you will also see one similar like this.

3744
07:14:25.710 --> 07:14:28.600
Ratnajyothi: Okay, Ultimate Data Sensor Jamie, okay.

3745
07:14:28.600 --> 07:14:33.159
Monal Kumar: Yes, you will see two of them. If you're not able to see, check with the counseling team, and they will help you, alright?

3746
07:14:33.160 --> 07:14:35.430
Ratnajyothi: Can you click on that, where? Yeah.

3747
07:14:35.430 --> 07:14:36.739
Monal Kumar: I can click on that.

3748
07:14:36.740 --> 07:14:38.880
Ratnajyothi: And .

3749
07:14:41.130 --> 07:14:45.579
Monal Kumar: continue, if I do the continue, you will see this. See this live session introduction, can you see?

3750
07:14:45.580 --> 07:14:46.770
Ratnajyothi: Okay, okay,

3751
07:14:46.770 --> 07:14:50.690
Monal Kumar: there are all the courses. This… all the things I've taught, but now…

3752
07:14:50.690 --> 07:14:52.359
Ratnajyothi: Okay. Different mentors also.

3753
07:14:52.490 --> 07:14:53.450
Monal Kumar: Alright.

3754
07:14:53.450 --> 07:15:09.889
Ratnajyothi: Okay. And one more question is, actually, where I'm working, one company, there, that company is having a deduplication engine. Currently, we don't have any AI-related stuff in that.

3755
07:15:09.890 --> 07:15:14.600
Ratnajyothi: Can we achieve that, engine functionality in AI?

3756
07:15:15.340 --> 07:15:24.520
Monal Kumar: not even only, because, you know, the functionality, I don't, right? I don't understand what is actually going on. If you learn AI, then you will know whether it is being there, whether we can replicate it or not.

3757
07:15:24.860 --> 07:15:25.790
Ratnajyothi: Okay, good.

3758
07:15:25.790 --> 07:15:26.570
Monal Kumar: water?

3759
07:15:26.570 --> 07:15:31.369
Ratnajyothi: Actually, I'm, files of experience in Java.

3760
07:15:31.640 --> 07:15:40.359
Ratnajyothi: So, now I am… I want to transition into the AI, and I want to… these concepts you introduce into the AI in my company.

3761
07:15:40.360 --> 07:15:40.820
Monal Kumar: Yes.

3762
07:15:40.820 --> 07:15:41.870
Ratnajyothi: That is my agenda.

3763
07:15:41.870 --> 07:15:46.239
Monal Kumar: You will… you will know that once you learn it, then you will know what things can be translated.

3764
07:15:46.610 --> 07:15:47.480
Ratnajyothi: Okay.

3765
07:15:47.480 --> 07:15:48.420
Monal Kumar: Yeah.

3766
07:15:49.310 --> 07:15:51.269
Ratnajyothi: Okay. Thank you.

3767
07:15:51.270 --> 07:15:53.009
Monal Kumar: Pure, dear, yes, you're welcome.

3768
07:15:53.300 --> 07:15:57.150
Monal Kumar: Alright guys, imagoti's done.

3769
07:15:57.390 --> 07:16:04.159
Monal Kumar: There's no other handlist after these two people, okay? It is already time. It is almost…

3770
07:16:04.320 --> 07:16:07.939
Monal Kumar: 7 minutes? Yeah. Mayuresh, you're next.

3771
07:16:09.400 --> 07:16:13.750
Monal Kumar: Mayuresh and Abeh are the last people, then we will close the session, alright?

3772
07:16:14.030 --> 07:16:15.090
Monal Kumar: Mayuresh?

3773
07:16:19.530 --> 07:16:20.830
Monal Kumar: There's…

3774
07:16:24.280 --> 07:16:25.020
Monal Kumar: Right?

3775
07:16:25.230 --> 07:16:28.470
Monal Kumar: Abe, you can ask your question if Mayuresh is not… okay, Mayuresh?

3776
07:16:28.830 --> 07:16:29.400
Mayuresh Balsaraf: Hello?

3777
07:16:29.720 --> 07:16:30.910
Monal Kumar: Hello? Yes, Mahesh?

3778
07:16:31.290 --> 07:16:33.199
Mayuresh Balsaraf: I'm gonna… am I audible?

3779
07:16:33.200 --> 07:16:33.840
Monal Kumar: Yes, you're audible.

3780
07:16:34.690 --> 07:16:39.130
Mayuresh Balsaraf: So, it was a very nice induction season, and

3781
07:16:39.260 --> 07:16:45.159
Mayuresh Balsaraf: The peers are also so experienced. I recently joined a company, I'm a pretty sure.

3782
07:16:45.310 --> 07:16:48.939
Mayuresh Balsaraf: And I recently joined a company, MNC company, and

3783
07:16:49.080 --> 07:16:52.360
Mayuresh Balsaraf: I have been, given an,

3784
07:16:52.590 --> 07:16:57.000
Mayuresh Balsaraf: a C-sharp role there, and I'm learning C-sharp and other frameworks.

3785
07:16:57.190 --> 07:17:01.880
Mayuresh Balsaraf: So I was very keen to learn the data science and artificial intelligence from my

3786
07:17:02.040 --> 07:17:06.670
Mayuresh Balsaraf: We take, so I've obtained some, NPDL courses.

3787
07:17:06.790 --> 07:17:08.189
Mayuresh Balsaraf: which I've cleared also.

3788
07:17:08.190 --> 07:17:10.020
Monal Kumar: NPTL courses.

3789
07:17:10.810 --> 07:17:13.820
Monal Kumar: Are you talking about NPTEL?

3790
07:17:14.410 --> 07:17:15.480
Mayuresh Balsaraf: Yes, yes, yes.

3791
07:17:15.640 --> 07:17:18.709
Monal Kumar: Yeah, I've done those courses as well, those are very boring courses.

3792
07:17:19.310 --> 07:17:20.929
Monal Kumar: Yeah, but, .

3793
07:17:21.190 --> 07:17:24.919
Mayuresh Balsaraf: teaching the professor teaches,

3794
07:17:24.920 --> 07:17:25.390
Monal Kumar: Yeah.

3795
07:17:26.130 --> 07:17:36.930
Monal Kumar: See, professors also taught me, but I've learned nothing. I have taken NPTL in my college, in my college time. I've taken for Java or something, they also have percentages.

3796
07:17:37.140 --> 07:17:43.090
Monal Kumar: And I got bare minimum there, and thank you very much, Shivangil. Yes, Mayuresh, tell me.

3797
07:17:43.410 --> 07:17:48.260
Mayuresh Balsaraf: So, I, I want to thank you for the session.

3798
07:17:48.410 --> 07:17:52.249
Mayuresh Balsaraf: And I'm very excited to learn, You're gonna be…

3799
07:17:52.250 --> 07:17:57.790
Monal Kumar: Thank you, Myersh. Thank you very much. Thanks for staying just to tell me this. Thank you very much.

3800
07:17:57.790 --> 07:18:02.380
Mayuresh Balsaraf: Actually, actually, I was searching for my microphone, but I understood that,

3801
07:18:02.510 --> 07:18:08.559
Mayuresh Balsaraf: When my time comes, there is an option of getting a new… I was searching, I was… I want to talk…
