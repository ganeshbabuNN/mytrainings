12
00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:11.176

15
00:01:21.627 --> 00:01:28.457
Monal S: Oh, poor Shotam. What do you mean by didn't get chance to ask? You just have to raise a hand. There is an option of raising a hand.


16
00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:39.667
Monal S: Trust me when I say that it was 7 hours, and whoever raised the hand, I answered. Maybe you can check that functionality, alright?

21
00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:29.666
Monal S: I missed the induction, did we cover? Guys, no topics are covered yet, okay? And I hope everyone got to know what is the today's class agenda. Everyone saw the email. Guys, in chat, let me know what is today's agenda.

Monal S: Guys, you will not be able to see anyone's chat, I am the admin, only I will be able to see everyone's chat.


23
00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:53.316
Monal S: Because we don't want… this is how we roll here, okay? If everyone will be able to see everyone's chat and reply, then it will be chaotic here. Only I will be able to see your chat, that's all.


24
00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:57.657

00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:20.947
Monal S: How many of you got the mail?


30
00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:38.567
Monal S: about today's class. Okay, people are getting it. Whoever is not getting, maybe please check your spam or junk, sometimes it gets there, please check it. People are getting the mail. If you still don't get it, please check with the team, maybe raise the query, if you still don't see in spam, alright?


31
00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:39.687
Monal S: Okay.


32
00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:50.167
Monal S: Alright, so let me set the pace, because this is where people get confused. Not regarding the topics, but for our course, right?


33
00:03:50.167 --> 00:04:01.017
Monal S: I'm unable to do email verification, guys. Just, connect with the team, because their backend is not being handled by us. What we can do is we can raise the query, and they will solve it for you, alright?


34
00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:04.866
Monal S: Alright, I hope everyone is able to see my screen.


35
00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:10.016
Monal S: Everyone is able to see today's date, 1401-2026, alright.


36
00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:14.296
Monal S: Okay, before even starting, I'm not starting on the topic part, alright?


37
00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:20.026
Monal S: Okay, let me set the pace for how we are going to roll in the class.


38
00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:35.996
Monal S: what Chris had already mentioned, what we are going to do, okay? So guys, on Wednesday, what is class timing? I'm talking about IST, you guys can convert it to your time zone. It is 8.30 to 10.30 IST.


39
00:04:36.727 --> 00:04:41.866
Monal S: Okay? IST. Then, we have Saturday and Sunday.


40
00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:47.816
Monal S: Saturday and Sunday. What is the timing of Saturday and Sunday?

42
00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:04.397
Monal S: Alright, 9 to 1, IST, it is in AM.


43
00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:10.797
Monal S: I know 1 is kind of a PM, but yes, 9 to 1, okay? Not AM.


44
00:05:11.017 --> 00:05:14.447
Monal S: Let me revise it, otherwise people will say, no.


45
00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:23.646
Monal S: What Krista told me… told you guys? Who is going to teach you the first half of the course?


46
00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:26.747
Monal S: Who is going to teach you the first half of the course?


47
00:05:30.577 --> 00:05:33.667
Monal S: I want all of you to be in the same page.


48
00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:37.576
Monal S: Mentor is Monal.


49
00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:53.286
Monal S: And not just Python, if you check the syllabus, still, Machine Learning for NLP, there is a module called Machine Learning for NLP. I will teach you. And I am here to set your base so that you can become a great engineer. This is what I'm here for.


50
00:05:53.407 --> 00:05:58.786
Monal S: Alright? And we want to give you more flavor, so once I'm done with my part, you will see other mentors.


51
00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:16.177
Monal S: Okay, Dawal, hey, Dawal. See, guys, my previous students are also here, and… let's see, guys. And this year, I'm going to plan a lot of things that is going to help you in your jobs, in your interviews. Not here, because there are a lot of things I will set in my YouTube, it is already there.


52
00:06:16.527 --> 00:06:28.877
Monal S: Alright, so this is the pace. And guys, this is where we are in Saturday and Sunday class, this is where we are going to learn our maximum portion of the class.


53
00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:36.686
Monal S: In Wednesday class, this is kind of a… think of this as a boost in our syllabus.


54
00:06:38.207 --> 00:06:56.457
Monal S: Alright? We need to improve our pace. There are people here from tech as well as non-tech. We cannot always go with tech people. We have to consider everyone, alright? So, Wednesday class is kind of giving ourselves boost, increase the speed of the class.


55
00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:59.356
Monal S: And cover smaller things in business day.


56
00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:02.106
Monal S: Is everyone clear what they're going to do in Wednesday?


57
00:07:02.237 --> 00:07:04.296
Monal S: It is only 2 hours.


58
00:07:06.137 --> 00:07:14.177
Monal S: Alright? We are not… me, personally, other mentor might do it differently, but me, personally, I am the mentor of the first half of this course.


59
00:07:14.177 --> 00:07:27.486
Monal S: What we will do, for the sake of class, because this is night time here in IST, alright, in India, what we will do, we will try to not have Q&As, discussion, or not a big one.


60
00:07:27.487 --> 00:07:32.466
Monal S: Because it is going to… because everyone knows that Q&A can extend to 2-3 more hours.


61
00:07:32.857 --> 00:07:50.516
Monal S: Right? But here, if you see, we have Q&A mandatory here. After 3 hours of class of Saturday and Sunday, the last hour is dedicated to our Q&A. And it's not like we are only going to take it Q&A in only 1 hour. If it extends to 3 more hours, I'm totally fine with that.


62
00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:58.427
Monal S: But if you're always stuck in the Q&A, even in smaller fashions, we cannot have that boost which we are considering.


63
00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:06.977
Monal S: Is everyone clear with this one? Everyone agrees. Guys, you all have to agree. It's not like I'm planning the course. You all are also planning with me.


64
00:08:08.027 --> 00:08:15.906
Monal S: Everyone, even if you're a beginner, if you know me, guys, I'm not going to run away from your queries. I'm here to solve your queries.


65
00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:22.997
Monal S: So, if you think that queries are not being answered, it is because in Wednesday, it will waste everyone's time.


66
00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:32.897
Monal S: Agree? Guys, I am here for even beginner people. I will take that responsibility. So, trust me on that.


67
00:08:33.777 --> 00:08:50.906
Monal S: Trust me on that, alright? So, this is what we are going to do. So, save your queries, because Wednesday's class is going to be smaller topics, covered it, then ask it in the later part. Thank you, alright? So, is everyone clear with the pace of how we are going to do things here with me? Yes, all right.


68
00:08:51.167 --> 00:09:06.866
Monal S: Now let's talk about today's agenda, and one more thing which is very interesting today, there are a lot of people asking, and team just called me, and my answer also just called me, so you will be getting one special thing, alright? So let's talk about today's agenda.


69
00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:10.547
Monal S: Alright, in every class, we will set the agenda.


70
00:09:10.807 --> 00:09:21.637
Monal S: Yes, Kiana, we have… guys, we will ask the questions later, okay? I'm going to focus on the topic so that we can get the most out of this one hour, almost. Alright, agenda.


71
00:09:21.637 --> 00:09:31.077
Monal S: So what we are going to do, because everyone for… this is Ultimate Data Science course, you should not think that this is a RAC course, this is a GenTI course. That is the later part.


72
00:09:31.077 --> 00:09:37.316
Monal S: Until and unless everyone means everyone is on the same page. Tech, non-tech, even tech people.


73
00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:48.537
Monal S: from colleges might not know all the tech. Until and unless everyone is on the same page, the class will not improve. So what I will do, in today's class, I will start with computers.


74
00:09:48.537 --> 00:09:59.226
Monal S: Even tech people might not know all the things, but computer, I'm not just saying that I will talk about just input devices and others. I will set the context in such a way that whatever tools which we are going to use.


75
00:09:59.257 --> 00:10:05.877
Monal S: Whatever tools which we are going to use for development, not just data science, we understand why we are using it.


76
00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:11.587
Monal S: Is everyone clear? Computer, tools, it also covers installation.


77
00:10:14.407 --> 00:10:15.427
Monal S: Alright?


78
00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:24.986
Monal S: So we will understand what are computers, you will understand tools, installation, and I will also tell you why we are using certain things, and


79
00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:31.747
Monal S: what it solves, alright? So, why is it necessary? Yes, guys, I will not remove the basics.


80
00:10:32.747 --> 00:10:39.567
Monal S: Once it is done, then we have… Special, announcement.


81
00:10:41.377 --> 00:10:55.847
Monal S: A special announcement, my answer will join around 10 PM, so I have less time. It is already 8.39 PM here. Till 10, I'm going to support you, 10, 10, 10.20, but my answer is going to join for that.


82
00:10:55.847 --> 00:11:06.086
Monal S: So, we are going to complete all of that. If we are stuck somewhere, we can cover it later. At start, this is the pace which we are going to do. Is everyone ready for today's agenda?


83
00:11:06.217 --> 00:11:08.447
Monal S: Guys, are we ready for today's class?


84
00:11:08.577 --> 00:11:09.717
Monal S: Everyone?


85
00:11:10.007 --> 00:11:15.896
Monal S: So, even if you're from tech people, you understand all of this, please listen carefully, I want all of you on the same page.


86
00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:20.676
Monal S: Alright? So don't complain, sir, if the class is too basic, guys.


87
00:11:20.777 --> 00:11:23.207
Monal S: It is my duty, alright? That's great.


88
00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:27.596
Monal S: Guys, I will provide the notes, don't worry.


89
00:11:28.107 --> 00:11:31.027
Monal S: I will provide the notes. Alright, so let's get started.


90
00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:34.666
Monal S: So, first, let's talk about,


91
00:11:35.677 --> 00:11:48.167
Monal S: Guys, don't worry about it, don't say I don't know anything, I'm not… I don't know data science. I'm literally teaching you from very scratch, not even data science. Please focus, don't focus on chat, please focus here in the screen, alright?


92
00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:51.587
Monal S: Let me remove myself from here. Okay.


93
00:11:51.697 --> 00:11:52.577
Monal S: Okay.


94
00:11:52.747 --> 00:11:54.996
Monal S: So, first of all, let me write.


95
00:11:55.317 --> 00:12:03.067
Monal S: Computers. I know you can see all of these drawings, very simple one, but it is important for us to understand. Let me write it here. Okay.


96
00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:08.867
Monal S: Everyone, write in the chat, in very short, what do you think a computer is?


97
00:12:09.587 --> 00:12:17.057
Monal S: In short, what do you think a computer is? Guys, you cannot see chat, only I can see chat. You guys can… whatever you guys will ping, I can see that.


98
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.077
Monal S: So, computer is a machine


99
00:12:20.937 --> 00:12:28.996
Monal S: Very simple. You will understand why I'm teaching all of this. We will create a bigger picture. Computer is a machine that takes machine


100
00:12:32.087 --> 00:12:35.267
Monal S: That takes… Input.


101
00:12:36.147 --> 00:12:38.266
Monal S: Machine that takes input.


102
00:12:44.787 --> 00:12:48.507
Monal S: Process it, and produces output.


103
00:12:49.097 --> 00:12:55.347
Monal S: So what it does, it takes input, processes it, and produce an output.


104
00:12:55.547 --> 00:13:04.956
Monal S: Alright? A process can be anything, we will talk about that later, but a process can be anything. Is everyone clear with a simple definition? Even a calculator is also a computer.


105
00:13:04.957 --> 00:13:22.546
Monal S: you provide 2 plus 2, that is your input, it does the processing of 2 plus 2, then in output, you will see a 4. That is a computer. A calculator is also a computer. Computer does not always means a bigger computer, or a quantum computer is a computer. Anything can be a computer, if it processes it and produces an output.


106
00:13:23.037 --> 00:13:27.546
Monal S: Alright? Now, how many of you know input and output device?


107
00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:36.496
Monal S: What is the definition of input device? What is the definition of input device? Guys, revise it for non-tech people. What is an input device?


108
00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:48.427
Monal S: Input device or device, I'm just going to give you on a very high level, okay? Device… device that


109
00:13:49.207 --> 00:13:52.747
Monal S: Talk to your computer.


110
00:13:53.467 --> 00:14:01.447
Monal S: These are devices that talks to computer. Computer does not talk to them. They talk to computer. So, it means


111
00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:06.926
Monal S: This is how the flow looks like. Input goes to computer.


112
00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:08.567
Monal S: It is one way.


113
00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:12.416
Monal S: Input goes to computer. What are the examples of this?


114
00:14:12.567 --> 00:14:13.647
Monal S: Mouse.


115
00:14:14.117 --> 00:14:15.147
Monal S: Keyboard.


116
00:14:18.647 --> 00:14:22.797
Monal S: Alright, simple, this is what we use. Now let's talk about output device.


117
00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:29.136
Monal S: Whoever thinks class is going fast, please revise it, 2 hours class. What is output device?


118
00:14:32.057 --> 00:14:38.307
Monal S: Device used to Sure.


119
00:14:40.097 --> 00:14:46.006
Monal S: output, from the computer.


120
00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:51.197
Monal S: It is otherwise. Here, we have computer.


121
00:14:51.907 --> 00:14:59.276
Monal S: We are not getting in computer, we are getting from computer, and we see it somewhere else.


122
00:15:01.277 --> 00:15:07.186
Monal S: not just C, but… I'm just writing it true here, alright? What are the examples of that?


123
00:15:07.337 --> 00:15:09.436
Monal S: Your monitor, your screen.


124
00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:14.657
Monal S: The screen. Monitor, you can call it as printer.


125
00:15:15.527 --> 00:15:17.667
Monal S: You can also say speaker.


126
00:15:20.757 --> 00:15:23.186
Monal S: You can also say speaker, yes?


127
00:15:23.687 --> 00:15:31.077
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand my handwriting? I'm not… I'm not saying this is the best handwriting you will get, but are you able to understand it?


128
00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:48.356
Monal S: This is my first… after long, I'm writing, so it will improve in truth, but it cannot improve a lot, alright? Yes. Alright, so this is input devices, output devices, computer. So now we know what comes here, what comes here.


129
00:15:48.507 --> 00:15:57.787
Monal S: And we still don't know this process. Yes, guys, please manage my handwriting. I'm now too old to learn my new handwriting, alright? Yes?


130
00:15:58.787 --> 00:16:07.986
Monal S: Guys, which one is responsible for this part? We know input, we know output, but what do we mean by process? What actually happens here?


131
00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:13.287
Monal S: So, now we will talk about the brain.


132
00:16:14.037 --> 00:16:20.476
Monal S: Currently, we're talking about just computers. The brain of the computer is called a CPU. The full form is…


133
00:16:21.107 --> 00:16:26.417
Monal S: Central… processing unit.


134
00:16:27.327 --> 00:16:34.297
Monal S: Alright? Central processing unit. This is responsible for doing the calculation.


135
00:16:36.317 --> 00:16:44.516
Monal S: Alright? It is responsible for doing the calculation, and calculation is nothing but if you divide a process.


136
00:16:44.947 --> 00:16:48.596
Monal S: If you divide any process into subparts.


137
00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.807
Monal S: It can be further divided into lots of calculations.


138
00:16:53.537 --> 00:17:00.377
Monal S: Is everyone clear? Guys, it is not just computers, we are going to learn a lot of things. You will understand why I'm telling you all of that.


139
00:17:00.767 --> 00:17:09.416
Monal S: It will all make sense. It will all make sense just today. People who are from technical might say that, this first class, why we are talking about CPU? You will understand why.


140
00:17:10.257 --> 00:17:18.256
Monal S: process can be splitted into further calculation, that is calculation. So, let's suppose I will talk about… okay.


141
00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:31.656
Monal S: This is CPU. One interesting fact about CPU is, CPU has… okay, everyone tell me what is your system memory? In your phone, in your laptop, what is your system memory? Tell me yours, everyone.


142
00:17:33.557 --> 00:17:37.407
Monal S: How much RAM you have, how much storage you have, just tell me.


143
00:17:37.677 --> 00:17:42.287
Monal S: So people are talking about that they have RAM of 8GB.


144
00:17:42.477 --> 00:17:50.436
Monal S: Some people are saying they are 16GB. In terms of storage, some people might say that they have 128GB in their phone.


145
00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:52.557
Monal S: Yes? Yes?


146
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:54.827
Monal S: Alright?


147
00:17:56.407 --> 00:18:13.226
Monal S: CPU is a chip which has very low memory. Keep this in mind, I will tell you why. It has very low memory, or we can say it has very short-term memory.


148
00:18:14.437 --> 00:18:22.417
Monal S: I will show you configurations of my CPU. I will go to Task Manager, and you will see some processes here.


149
00:18:22.627 --> 00:18:23.717
Monal S: Just wait.


150
00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:30.447
Monal S: Is everyone able to see my CPU?


151
00:18:30.757 --> 00:18:35.007
Monal S: It is 3% utilized. You can see,


152
00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:44.646
Monal S: 12MB at the bottom, 64MB at the bottom, 768KB. This is the memory of my CPU that we call it as cache.


153
00:18:44.797 --> 00:18:55.656
Monal S: CPU does not have access to a lot of memory in your system, it might be very low. Because I have a powerful CPU, I still have around 78MB is,


154
00:18:55.957 --> 00:19:04.926
Monal S: memory accessible to my CPU. So, when we say 4.73, Alright? When we say 4.73,


155
00:19:06.047 --> 00:19:10.887
Monal S: Let's suppose a CPU speed is 3 GHz, G at Z.


156
00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:25.997
Monal S: Alright? It means that our CPU can do millions of calculation. This GSJ can be converted to millions and billions also, but I'm just giving you an approximate. It can do 3 millionth calculation per second. Approximate.


157
00:19:27.187 --> 00:19:28.497
Monal S: Is this fast?


158
00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.816
Monal S: Is this fast, yes or no?


159
00:19:33.617 --> 00:19:34.817
Monal S: Yes or no?


160
00:19:45.637 --> 00:19:46.597
Monal S: Yes?


161
00:19:49.047 --> 00:19:52.797
Monal S: Let me check the correct number, if it… if it is present.


162
00:19:53.297 --> 00:19:59.557
Monal S: Okay, it means 3 billion cycles per core. It is billion, guys.


163
00:19:59.857 --> 00:20:00.827
Monal S: Okay?


164
00:20:00.947 --> 00:20:15.417
Monal S: It is billions of cycles, but we don't need to go there. It is a very huge number, so we don't need to do that, alright? Don't worry about it, I'm just giving you some numbers, but it is very fast. Our CPU are very, very, very fast.


165
00:20:15.417 --> 00:20:26.906
Monal S: And it does… the job of the CPU is to do some processing, but processing is nothing but a lot of different calculations, alright? Now let's talk about one important thing that is called as RAM.


166
00:20:26.917 --> 00:20:31.586
Monal S: It is important to understand RAM once you become a senior developer.


167
00:20:31.877 --> 00:20:37.436
Monal S: Alright? So, RAM is nothing but the full form of RAM is random.


168
00:20:39.357 --> 00:20:46.347
Monal S: Access, memory. No need to understand all of this full form, you don't have to remember it. I'm just giving you all of this instruction.


169
00:20:46.977 --> 00:21:06.897
Monal S: Alright? What it means, what we are going to do with that, alright? So, RAM, as I mentioned, our… as I showed you, our… my CPU currently has around approximate 700MB of RAM. Do you think this is… this is necessary… this is, you can say, meeting the requirement of running our system?


170
00:21:07.487 --> 00:21:17.797
Monal S: Even if I open Google Chrome, see this? Even if I open Google Chrome, you can see my Google Chrome itself is taking around 1.2GB of memory.


171
00:21:17.947 --> 00:21:25.217
Monal S: And as I told you, our system that is CPU, I have only 78. Do you think Google Chrome is going to fit into that memory?


172
00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:28.617
Monal S: Do you think Google Chrome is fitted to this memory?


173
00:21:29.197 --> 00:21:47.876
Monal S: No. So what we need? We need extra space, and using that space, our CPU can open it, use it, and utilize it. And that memory, we call it as a RAM. So RAM is used for our processes, our application runs on RAM, not on CPU memory. Is everyone clear?


174
00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:52.867
Monal S: our application, whenever I run Python also, Python, Java, C++,


175
00:21:53.227 --> 00:22:02.346
Monal S: It is going to open in RAM, and whenever I do 2 plus 2, the process is going to be executed by my CPU. Is this part…


176
00:22:22.187 --> 00:22:28.147
Monal S: Puts it on… puts it on RAM,


177
00:22:29.797 --> 00:22:35.777
Monal S: puts it on RAM. When you open it, when you…


178
00:22:35.957 --> 00:22:39.246
Monal S: open it. Sorry if I'm writing it wrong. Yeah, okay?


179
00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:55.157
Monal S: Alright, the final thing about the component, then I will mix all the components, then we will go to the next stage, the intermediate stage. Now we talked about RAM, but in your store, in your phone, you store a lot of image and videos, yes or no?


180
00:22:55.627 --> 00:23:07.327
Monal S: you store a lot of image and videos. Image and videos, even without opening it, even without running the application, it exists in your system, yes or no?


181
00:23:08.217 --> 00:23:12.057
Monal S: Guys, is my voice breaking? Is my voice breaking?


182
00:23:12.697 --> 00:23:19.236
Monal S: No. Okay, my voice is not breaking. Maybe because of some internet issue from your side, it can happen, okay? Okay, great.


183
00:23:19.817 --> 00:23:27.157
Monal S: Even without opening our image, with some application, it still exists in our system.


184
00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:31.536
Monal S: So, we require a separate kind of a space, that is…


185
00:23:31.787 --> 00:23:37.746
Monal S: We call it as hard drive, hard disk drive SSR. How many of you heard this?


186
00:23:37.967 --> 00:23:42.127
Monal S: This is nothing but the storage. We call that as storage.


187
00:23:43.017 --> 00:23:49.246
Monal S: Here, we store our data. RAM is where system uses to open the application. Both are different.


188
00:23:50.327 --> 00:23:57.197
Monal S: Both are different, alright? This is where we store our files, system, memory, anything.


189
00:23:57.467 --> 00:24:11.166
Monal S: And RAM is where, when we open any application, it exists here. I'm not going into depth, just talking about in high level. Is everyone clear? Even non-tech people are able to understand a simple difference?


190
00:24:13.347 --> 00:24:14.297
Monal S: Alright.


191
00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:23.417
Monal S: When you restart your phone, when you restart your phone, The file still exists.


192
00:24:23.997 --> 00:24:24.967
Monal S: Yes?


193
00:24:25.997 --> 00:24:35.416
Monal S: the file still exists. But when you restart your phone, does your app that you have opened before still… still running? No. It gets…


194
00:24:35.917 --> 00:24:37.827
Monal S: It gets stopped.


195
00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:43.916
Monal S: So, whatever is present on the RAM, RAM memory gets restarted again.


196
00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:45.847
Monal S: Are we clear?


197
00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:48.167
Monal S: RAM gets cleared.


198
00:24:48.277 --> 00:24:59.677
Monal S: RAM storage… gets cleared, These are not permanent.


199
00:25:01.277 --> 00:25:06.027
Monal S: But file exist means… This is permanent storage.


200
00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:20.267
Monal S: So, as a developer, if you want to store something permanently, you will use RAM or hard drive, or SSD. Tell me, as a developer, if you want to store something, you will store in RAM, hard drive, SSD.


201
00:25:20.897 --> 00:25:23.336
Monal S: HDD or SSD.


202
00:25:24.187 --> 00:25:29.787
Monal S: And if you want to do some calculation temporarily, even though calculation is 4GB,


203
00:25:30.027 --> 00:25:33.016
Monal S: Where you will store it, temporarily, RAM.


204
00:25:33.787 --> 00:25:35.907
Monal S: Alright, very big difference.


205
00:25:38.107 --> 00:25:39.067
Monal S: Alright?


206
00:25:41.287 --> 00:25:51.707
Monal S: Alright? So, for people who are asking, if I talk about HDD, HDDD is… Hard disk drive.


207
00:25:52.827 --> 00:25:55.236
Monal S: How many of you have seen cassettes?


208
00:25:55.477 --> 00:25:59.867
Monal S: Cassettes, CD, DVD, how many of you have seen that?


209
00:26:02.197 --> 00:26:14.656
Monal S: So, hard disk drive is kind of a hardware which uses cassets-like thing, it is magnetic, and it uses that to store read-write from that storage.


210
00:26:16.187 --> 00:26:24.017
Monal S: Alright? If I talk about SDD, SSD, sorry, not SDD. SSD.


211
00:26:25.297 --> 00:26:27.956
Monal S: SDD is solid.


212
00:26:28.147 --> 00:26:30.287
Monal S: State. Drive.


213
00:26:31.937 --> 00:26:33.457
Monal S: It is a chip.


214
00:26:33.687 --> 00:26:45.436
Monal S: It is a chip enclosed in PCB. PCB is nothing but your chip. That green color, how many have you seen that green color chip in system? Green color chip in the system? That is…


215
00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:49.546
Monal S: Your chip, but in that chip, they have memory.


216
00:26:49.687 --> 00:27:06.336
Monal S: That is SSD. SSD does not have any moving component. Here, we have CD kind of a thing. It moves and reads. That's why SDD is slow. Here, we don't have any moving component, and it is very close to the CPU, I will tell you. That's why it is fast.


217
00:27:07.487 --> 00:27:09.706
Monal S: Guys, class is already started!


218
00:27:11.147 --> 00:27:13.417
Monal S: Are we clear? Is everyone clear?


219
00:27:15.947 --> 00:27:19.106
Monal S: Now comes the intermediate part. Everyone?


220
00:27:20.717 --> 00:27:21.967
Monal S: Intermediate.


221
00:27:23.917 --> 00:27:24.897
Monal S: All right.


222
00:27:26.177 --> 00:27:31.017
Monal S: So, where is our motherboard? How many of you have seen motherboard?


223
00:27:31.467 --> 00:27:45.757
Monal S: In phone also, we have motherboard. This is our motherboard. Everyone, I'm telling you each and everything that will help you in future, even if you think that it… why Monosar is even teaching, but you will understand each and everything in future, alright?


224
00:27:47.417 --> 00:27:48.237
Monal S: Okay.


225
00:27:51.067 --> 00:28:06.857
Monal S: I'm just telling you, okay? This is motherboard. Your motherboard is a chip which can have all different elements, okay? This is a place for CPU. You buy a CPU, if you want to buy Intel CPU, you place it here. This is how RAM looks like.


226
00:28:06.927 --> 00:28:19.137
Monal S: Okay, RAM also looks like SSD, but SSD is having permanent storage, RAM is having not permanent storage, alright? So, RAM kind of gets here, in this place.


227
00:28:19.137 --> 00:28:30.716
Monal S: Alright? Now, this is a motherboard which has some… okay. This is a motherboard where you provide the power, and it starts. Where it provides the power, and it starts.


228
00:28:30.797 --> 00:28:37.206
Monal S: CPU is responsible for doing calculation. RAM is responsible for storing our application.


229
00:28:37.607 --> 00:28:39.907
Monal S: But how many of you think that


230
00:28:40.477 --> 00:28:45.477
Monal S: This is nothing but all circuits. Current is going all circuits.


231
00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:50.026
Monal S: How does CPU processes something, how do we see something on the screen?


232
00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:52.756
Monal S: Now comes the important part.


233
00:28:53.237 --> 00:29:03.906
Monal S: Alright? How does your computer know that you have 8GB of RAM, that you have a CPU, and that you have an operating system now that it can turn on?


234
00:29:04.887 --> 00:29:06.966
Monal S: How does their computer knows this?


235
00:29:08.467 --> 00:29:13.516
Monal S: How does your computer knows this when you start your computer? How does your computer knows this?


236
00:29:17.497 --> 00:29:21.277
Monal S: Guys, don't worry, it is intermediate level, you will understand now, okay?


237
00:29:22.977 --> 00:29:33.796
Monal S: Alright, so this is your CPU, it does not have any programming, this is your motherboard. In your motherboard, you have a very special software called as BIOS.


238
00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:52.417
Monal S: BIOS is a program that is… this is a program, guys, BIOS is a program that you install in your motherboard, it is motherboard compatible, and it tells your operat… and it tells that whether you have a valid OS or not to start, whether you have CPU, whether you have RAM.


239
00:29:52.417 --> 00:30:11.257
Monal S: So, to communicate with your motherboard, which is just a piece of hardware, which is just a piece of hardware with electronics, to communicate with that, we have written a piece of software called as BIOS. Is everyone clear? So, BIOS is the first programming language that communicates with our actual hardware.


240
00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:13.707
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


241
00:30:15.937 --> 00:30:22.886
Monal S: But tell me, as a user, do you… do you check BIOS? How many of you are here check BIOS? No.


242
00:30:23.307 --> 00:30:31.307
Monal S: We don't check BIOS. How many of you… Works directly with OS.


243
00:30:33.837 --> 00:30:37.187
Monal S: How many of you directly works with OS?


244
00:30:38.137 --> 00:30:47.947
Monal S: Everyone, even in mobile. So what happens? This is your CPU. Your CPU alone cannot do anything. Your CPU needs to provide instruction.


245
00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:52.596
Monal S: On that CPU, CPU is present in motherboard.


246
00:30:54.387 --> 00:30:58.326
Monal S: Motherboard, what it does? Guys, motherboard, what it does?


247
00:30:58.507 --> 00:31:06.657
Monal S: It provides a space where we can connect multiple elements, so CPU can… in the motherboard, CPU gets access to RAM.


248
00:31:07.277 --> 00:31:15.836
Monal S: Okay? And everyone knows now why we require RAM, so we can run application. CPU gets access to… what else? Storage.


249
00:31:16.017 --> 00:31:20.836
Monal S: Other storage, CPU gets access to input and output.


250
00:31:23.717 --> 00:31:31.407
Monal S: Alright? And now, on top of the CPU, what happens? We create our operating system.


251
00:31:31.507 --> 00:31:32.877
Monal S: Are we clear?


252
00:31:32.937 --> 00:31:51.896
Monal S: We create operating system because the above are very raw element. To create a house, we do require brick. This is a brick, this is sand, this is cement, but do you think that that is a house? No. For that to be a house, now we need to use this raw material to build something else.


253
00:31:53.607 --> 00:31:54.557
Monal S: Yes?


254
00:31:54.967 --> 00:32:02.036
Monal S: Yes? So, OS is an element… OS is an element that controls


255
00:32:02.457 --> 00:32:15.397
Monal S: your CPU. It controls how much RAM to allocate to Google Chrome, to your file browser, to your Spotify. It also controls that when you say, save a file.


256
00:32:15.987 --> 00:32:26.246
Monal S: it knows that in where I have to save file, in which storage, in what place I have to save file, all of these things is being handled by


257
00:32:26.547 --> 00:32:37.766
Monal S: All of these things is being handled by your operating system. So, operating system is a piece of software that controls the element of your hardware.


258
00:32:37.977 --> 00:32:44.297
Monal S: It communicates directly with your hardware. Is everyone clear?


259
00:32:45.637 --> 00:32:47.266
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


260
00:32:50.597 --> 00:33:00.997
Monal S: So, operating system can be created using different programming language, but that is also a program. It is also a program, it is also a software.


261
00:33:02.197 --> 00:33:03.557
Monal S: Are we clear?


262
00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.646
Monal S: Hi, everyone?


263
00:33:07.307 --> 00:33:08.217
Monal S: Alright.


264
00:33:09.697 --> 00:33:13.417
Monal S: If I show you this particular black screen.


265
00:33:14.707 --> 00:33:19.807
Monal S: Alright, this particular black screen. Let's suppose your computer does not have any UI.


266
00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:23.096
Monal S: Let's suppose your computer does not have any UI.


267
00:33:23.937 --> 00:33:29.216
Monal S: Alright? Then, how we are going to communicate with our memory, with our folder structure?


268
00:33:30.836 --> 00:33:31.847
Monal S: Anyone?


269
00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:40.066
Monal S: Using this black screen, this is the first tool which we are going to interact. This is called as Terminal.


270
00:33:40.957 --> 00:33:49.346
Monal S: Let's suppose I don't have anything, I don't have Windows, I don't have Linux, but I do need a tool to interact with my OS, yes or no?


271
00:33:49.957 --> 00:33:51.166
Monal S: Yes or no?


272
00:33:52.197 --> 00:34:00.127
Monal S: I know that OS is able to control my CPU, RAM, storage, and other things, but I do need a tool


273
00:34:00.277 --> 00:34:10.966
Monal S: But I do need a tool to interact with my operating system. If I'm not able to interact with my operating system, will I be able to give any task or perform anything?


274
00:34:11.587 --> 00:34:14.016
Monal S: perform anything? Will I be able to do it?


275
00:34:14.587 --> 00:34:21.056
Monal S: Tell me, everyone, will we all be able to do anything if we don't know a way to communicate with the operating system?


276
00:34:23.197 --> 00:34:28.546
Monal S: No, we cannot. So we require a tool. The first tool that we have is CDIS.


277
00:34:29.047 --> 00:34:34.727
Monal S: In here, if I show you our folder structure, is everyone able to see folders, create folders?


278
00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:43.847
Monal S: I'm able to create folder. I'm able to rename my folder. I'm able to see something else. I'm able to create a file as well.


279
00:34:44.987 --> 00:34:49.066
Monal S: Who is doing all of this? Guys, who is doing all of this?


280
00:34:49.407 --> 00:34:57.936
Monal S: With the help of operating system, operating system is giving instructions to my CPU, and CPU is executing process one by one.


281
00:34:58.887 --> 00:35:04.557
Monal S: So, it is operating system who is giving the correct instruction to the CPU, and we are able to do the work. Yes?


282
00:35:04.707 --> 00:35:09.207
Monal S: But if we don't have this UI, we still want to perform all of this.


283
00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:14.087
Monal S: So, currently, if you see, this is my folder location, yes or no?


284
00:35:14.917 --> 00:35:20.877
Monal S: Yes or no? I'm able to move back, I'm able to move forward, I'm able to go anywhere.


285
00:35:21.047 --> 00:35:32.556
Monal S: This is all because of operating system, the latest advanced operating system. But if I don't have all of this, let's see. I'm just going to give you one folder. See here.


286
00:35:32.727 --> 00:35:34.187
Monal S: Let me create a new one.


287
00:35:36.797 --> 00:35:40.227
Monal S: In downloads, I'm going to create something like…


288
00:35:40.957 --> 00:35:47.626
Monal S: Hey. Just a folder named as Hey. Alright? See this? Now we will not focus anywhere else.


289
00:35:48.147 --> 00:35:52.847
Monal S: This is where I am. What is the folder name which I just created?


290
00:35:53.237 --> 00:35:56.156
Monal S: What is the folder name which I just created? Hey.


291
00:35:56.547 --> 00:36:08.627
Monal S: So, if you check here, this hay, this hay has some path. Yes, this hay has some path. It is present inside my C drive, user's SCL downloads, hey.


292
00:36:08.817 --> 00:36:11.026
Monal S: So, let me go…


293
00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:16.886
Monal S: Now, if I write CD, just see here.


294
00:36:17.407 --> 00:36:19.626
Monal S: Is it showing the same address?


295
00:36:20.277 --> 00:36:22.616
Monal S: Is it showing us the same address?


296
00:36:25.507 --> 00:36:26.477
Monal S: Yes?


297
00:36:27.697 --> 00:36:32.266
Monal S: Now, say this. If I write, I'm just writing a command, don't need to remember any command.


298
00:36:32.397 --> 00:36:35.846
Monal S: Okay? Now I'm doing something else. Here, see this.


299
00:36:38.957 --> 00:36:43.636
Monal S: I did something here. I did something here, now let's see in the folder.


300
00:36:45.877 --> 00:36:47.737
Monal S: Where is our folder?


301
00:36:49.717 --> 00:36:52.346
Monal S: Was this file previously present?


302
00:36:52.787 --> 00:36:55.197
Monal S: Was this file previously present?


303
00:36:56.097 --> 00:37:01.897
Monal S: Were we able to give the instruction from that black screen and OS executed it?


304
00:37:03.237 --> 00:37:05.106
Monal S: and OS executed it.


305
00:37:05.247 --> 00:37:13.527
Monal S: So what we are able to do from this terminal, we are able to provide the same instruction which we do from this… all of these graphics.


306
00:37:13.637 --> 00:37:19.266
Monal S: Now, say this. Here, we are not able to see all the contents. Let's create a new file.


307
00:37:19.417 --> 00:37:21.787
Monal S: I'm just giving you just example.


308
00:37:22.987 --> 00:37:28.577
Monal S: Everyone should know what tools we are using. Now, let me erase everything so that I can see clearly.


309
00:37:28.847 --> 00:37:35.167
Monal S: Here, if I write DIR, Are we able to see these two files which we created?


310
00:37:35.607 --> 00:37:42.596
Monal S: Along with their time, directory, everything, What are we doing here?


311
00:37:43.287 --> 00:37:47.206
Monal S: we are giving instruction. So the first tool


312
00:37:48.097 --> 00:38:00.526
Monal S: The first tool which we are going to use a lot in production, when you become even 5 years experience, 12-year experience, this is the tool which you are going to communicate


313
00:38:01.317 --> 00:38:04.837
Monal S: that the first tool which we are calling it is, Terminal.


314
00:38:06.477 --> 00:38:10.146
Monal S: So, what Terminal does, guys? What terminal does?


315
00:38:10.417 --> 00:38:15.037
Monal S: Terminal is a tool, it is a… it's a tool to talk to an OS.


316
00:38:16.247 --> 00:38:17.247
Monal S: Yes?


317
00:38:19.337 --> 00:38:24.227
Monal S: It's a tool to talk to an OS. We can provide instruction


318
00:38:27.397 --> 00:38:32.527
Monal S: We can provide instruction to OS via terminal.


319
00:38:32.647 --> 00:38:34.866
Monal S: Also, we can provide


320
00:38:35.027 --> 00:38:47.137
Monal S: Also, we can provide our instruction via this UI. All of these things, the buttons, everything which we see on the screen, is also a way to interact with the operating system.


321
00:38:47.287 --> 00:38:55.697
Monal S: But as a coder, we want codes to be executed, you will understand why all of this. But is everyone able to truly understand what is a terminal?


322
00:38:56.087 --> 00:38:59.116
Monal S: Is everyone able to truly understand what is a terminal?


323
00:38:59.757 --> 00:39:06.796
Monal S: We can provide all kinds of instruction using Terminal, and we are going to use it today as well.


324
00:39:07.437 --> 00:39:08.857
Monal S: in Python.


325
00:39:11.047 --> 00:39:18.736
Monal S: Crystal clear. Next step. Guys, are you enjoying today's class? Is everyone able to learn and clear their concepts?


326
00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:24.876
Monal S: Great. Alright? Next, now that we know this tool.


327
00:39:25.207 --> 00:39:28.077
Monal S: This is giving instruction to OS.


328
00:39:28.677 --> 00:39:32.717
Monal S: Now, let's suppose… Next part, guys, this is next part.


329
00:39:33.527 --> 00:39:43.637
Monal S: Now, let's suppose I want to give my custom instructions, custom instructions, which is not present in the OS instruction.


330
00:39:47.087 --> 00:39:53.896
Monal S: instructions which is not present in the instructions which we can give the terminal. Let's suppose


331
00:39:54.077 --> 00:39:58.986
Monal S: I want to take… I want to take a picture.


332
00:39:59.807 --> 00:40:06.857
Monal S: R… For an example, let's suppose… yeah, I want to give an instruction like.


333
00:40:10.037 --> 00:40:23.146
Monal S: send my… query to… chat, GPT, and get… the result.


334
00:40:24.337 --> 00:40:27.127
Monal S: Now, let's suppose this instruction is…


335
00:40:27.257 --> 00:40:34.707
Monal S: not present, and cannot be executed, or cannot be provided directly to the OS. Now, this is a problem.


336
00:40:34.897 --> 00:40:35.857
Monal S: Yes?


337
00:40:36.037 --> 00:40:39.947
Monal S: Now, this is a problem. This instruction is not present.


338
00:40:40.377 --> 00:40:46.937
Monal S: How I'm going to communicate with my OS, so OS can provide me this query to chat GPT and get the result.


339
00:40:48.027 --> 00:40:57.356
Monal S: Okay? It means what? I want to perform some kind of an operation which is not present in my operating system knowledge.


340
00:40:57.627 --> 00:40:59.616
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand this?


341
00:41:00.007 --> 00:41:11.727
Monal S: instruction we want to execute, but our OS, the OS is also made from some kind of a program. Yes, OS is also made from some kind of a program, but that programming language


342
00:41:11.867 --> 00:41:18.367
Monal S: That programming language does not have a capability to execute our custom instruction.


343
00:41:18.767 --> 00:41:22.747
Monal S: So, what developers did, what developers did.


344
00:41:24.197 --> 00:41:28.457
Monal S: Developers created their own programming language.


345
00:41:29.467 --> 00:41:34.197
Monal S: Developers created their own programming language.


346
00:41:34.837 --> 00:41:42.407
Monal S: And this programming language And this programming language does not replace operating system.


347
00:41:42.637 --> 00:41:44.816
Monal S: This programming language


348
00:41:48.207 --> 00:41:53.067
Monal S: This programming language sits on top of OS.


349
00:41:55.417 --> 00:42:05.566
Monal S: this programming language sits on top of OS. So, using this new programming language, we are going to provide the instructions


350
00:42:05.767 --> 00:42:14.037
Monal S: And developers who create this programming language will provide a way to communicate to the OS, and OS communicates with


351
00:42:14.457 --> 00:42:20.657
Monal S: guys and OS communicates with… our hardware.


352
00:42:24.807 --> 00:42:26.087
Monal S: Are we clear?


353
00:42:26.417 --> 00:42:31.586
Monal S: Because the programming language to create an operating system is very hard. If…


354
00:42:31.817 --> 00:42:36.777
Monal S: If the instruction becomes very hard, will you and others are going to use it?


355
00:42:36.947 --> 00:42:40.936
Monal S: Guys, if mobile phones were very hard to use.


356
00:42:41.127 --> 00:42:54.806
Monal S: Is any one of us is going to use the mobile phone? No. It should be simple. Other people should be able to use it. So the main job of programming language is to provide the instruction in such a manner that people can provide it very easily.


357
00:42:55.297 --> 00:43:12.236
Monal S: So programming language can be of different type, but the one which we are going to use for data science is going… it should be simple, so we can focus more on… so that we can focus more on tasks, rather than how to code and communicate with hardware.


358
00:43:12.397 --> 00:43:15.667
Monal S: How to code, and hardware stuff.


359
00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:27.316
Monal S: We want to remove this dependency from the developer so that they can focus on tasks and do awesome things, rather than focus on


360
00:43:27.457 --> 00:43:32.457
Monal S: let's talk with RAM, let's talk with CPU, let's talk with other things, and that will create a more chaos.


361
00:43:32.597 --> 00:43:44.417
Monal S: And that's where programming languages come. There are different kind of programming languages, C, C++, C Sharp, Java, Python.


362
00:43:45.187 --> 00:43:49.766
Monal S: All of them, the main task of all of this programming languages to


363
00:43:50.317 --> 00:44:01.147
Monal S: provide a way to developers to write programs, programs that can be executed by operating system, and operating system will handle the other part, that is to communicate with


364
00:44:01.307 --> 00:44:02.927
Monal S: the hardware.


365
00:44:03.597 --> 00:44:04.897
Monal S: Are we clear?


366
00:44:05.197 --> 00:44:06.546
Monal S: Are we clear?


367
00:44:07.557 --> 00:44:08.637
Monal S: Everyone?


368
00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:17.097
Monal S: And the programming language, which we use for data science specifically, is… by 10.


369
00:44:19.067 --> 00:44:21.157
Monal S: is Python.


370
00:44:22.767 --> 00:44:33.887
Monal S: Are we clear? Guys, Python is more high level. Now, I will talk about high level. Guys, computers run on… if I talk about CPU, CPU only understand


371
00:44:35.987 --> 00:44:51.356
Monal S: CPU only understands electricity off and on, just like a switch. Guys, switch is also one very small component of the CPU, which does something. When switch is off, the light turns off. When switch is on, the light turns on.


372
00:44:51.387 --> 00:45:04.736
Monal S: When the electricity off, it means zero. When the electricity is on, it means 1. This 0 and 1, if you do a lot of different combinations and others, you create something called as…


373
00:45:05.037 --> 00:45:06.836
Monal S: binary language.


374
00:45:07.807 --> 00:45:11.947
Monal S: A language consists of only 0 and 1. Is everyone clear?


375
00:45:12.727 --> 00:45:20.216
Monal S: CPU has millions, billions of transistors, and using all of this combination, we do something.


376
00:45:21.257 --> 00:45:26.727
Monal S: Just for an example, I'm going to give you this example, just for an example, alright? Say this.


377
00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:33.397
Monal S: Alright? In mathematics, if I have to write one.


378
00:45:33.747 --> 00:45:44.886
Monal S: This is just 1. If I have to write 2, this is 2. But in binary, if I have to write 0, in binary, if I have to write 0, this is how I will mention it.


379
00:45:45.297 --> 00:45:47.096
Monal S: This means zero.


380
00:45:47.227 --> 00:45:59.056
Monal S: If I have to write 1, in binary, this is how I will write it. All are 0, 1, but this means 1. If I have to write 2, this is how I will write 2.


381
00:46:02.617 --> 00:46:13.726
Monal S: So you can see all different combinations of 0 and 1 create something, we don't have to focus on that. But CPU understands binary language, and guys, do you think that


382
00:46:14.167 --> 00:46:22.976
Monal S: Do you like this way of coding? If you have to write 1, 2, 3, do you want to write like this, or you want to write 1, 2, 3? Tell me!


383
00:46:28.247 --> 00:46:29.226
Monal S: Tell me.


384
00:46:33.777 --> 00:46:37.926
Monal S: Yeah, guys, I… this should not be like that. Is this fine now?


385
00:46:41.317 --> 00:46:59.956
Monal S: All of them as well, okay? So, the way human understands, this is human understandable language, this is computer understandable language, and when we say human understandable language, we say it as, hi… what do we say, guys?


386
00:47:01.867 --> 00:47:05.687
Monal S: I… Level… anyone?


387
00:47:07.977 --> 00:47:09.977
Monal S: High-level language.


388
00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:27.186
Monal S: Because it looks like how human communicates. So any language which you are able to understand and code very easily is called as high level. There are some other languages which is very hard and communicates directly with CPU, or the resources of CPU.


389
00:47:27.367 --> 00:47:35.286
Monal S: a language which is very tightly combined with our resources, RAM, CPU, those are called as


390
00:47:35.567 --> 00:47:41.846
Monal S: Low-level language, assembly language, all of them you can see here.


391
00:47:43.897 --> 00:47:59.647
Monal S: So, Python is a high-level language, because we cannot code directly easily. There are developers who can code with low-level languages, but I am not the developer, and I don't want you to become those developers. We want to complete this task.


392
00:48:01.327 --> 00:48:02.576
Monal S: Are we clear?


393
00:48:03.417 --> 00:48:04.766
Monal S: Are we clear?


394
00:48:06.147 --> 00:48:19.127
Monal S: Great. Next. Next very important part, again, I'm telling the flow. When we write something in Python, this is a code of Python. Print, hello world. I will show you. Print.


395
00:48:19.287 --> 00:48:28.707
Monal S: Hello world. This is a code which we write in Python, and once you write this in Python, your terminal shows it. I will show you this. See this.


396
00:48:29.017 --> 00:48:37.727
Monal S: Let me clear everything, I will write Python, and in Python, I will just write print, this is the instruction, don't copy, don't write anything, just see the screen.


397
00:48:38.067 --> 00:48:52.146
Monal S: Hello, world. This is a code. When I pass this instruction, I'm telling it, I'm telling my operating system, or my Python, that when I press enter, I want to see what is written in between.


398
00:48:52.777 --> 00:48:54.716
Monal S: Is it showing us the same thing?


399
00:48:55.227 --> 00:49:07.196
Monal S: Is it showing what we have written here? In the terminal, see, the output is coming in the terminal in my screen. This is Hello World. So, this is nothing but a Python code.


400
00:49:07.287 --> 00:49:15.397
Monal S: I will tell you one interesting thing. Python code gets converted to C or C++ code.


401
00:49:15.657 --> 00:49:32.956
Monal S: C or C++ code is more coupled with our RAM, so even though we are writing code in Python, we as a Python developer, we don't have to worry about it. Python is not that efficient in terms of memory. C and C++ is a language that is more tightly coupled with memory. It gets converted to that.


402
00:49:33.787 --> 00:49:40.027
Monal S: C and C++ communicates with operating system, operating system communicates with CPU,


403
00:49:40.497 --> 00:49:46.696
Monal S: Gets the job done, gets the job done, gets the job done, and then we will see, hello world.


404
00:49:46.967 --> 00:49:53.016
Monal S: Is everyone able to see the… everyone able to understand the flow of the output which we just saw?


405
00:49:54.117 --> 00:49:55.417
Monal S: Everyone…


406
00:49:59.737 --> 00:50:00.607
Monal S: Great.


407
00:50:02.557 --> 00:50:03.477
Monal S: Okay?


408
00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:06.326
Monal S: And something also happens in between.


409
00:50:08.207 --> 00:50:10.926
Monal S: Something also happens in between.


410
00:50:12.697 --> 00:50:14.207
Monal S: Can anyone tell me?


411
00:50:25.917 --> 00:50:26.907
Monal S: Okay?


412
00:50:27.067 --> 00:50:34.957
Monal S: Python, when we run here, Python, when we run here, it gets converted to something called as bytecode.


413
00:50:37.077 --> 00:50:44.977
Monal S: Okay? This, we will call it as middle… don't worry, guys, this is just a very high-level class. Even an interview don't require all of this.


414
00:50:46.807 --> 00:50:50.876
Monal S: Okay? Then it gets sent to your C++.


415
00:50:53.257 --> 00:50:58.506
Monal S: It handles all those RAM which is installed in your OS, and then it executes.


416
00:50:58.717 --> 00:51:02.026
Monal S: Alright? So this is how it works, but don't worry about it.


417
00:51:03.217 --> 00:51:11.066
Monal S: Don't worry about it, this is hap… this… if you run Python in Mac OS, Linux Windows, this is what happens for each and everything.


418
00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:23.016
Monal S: Alright, each and everything. Alright, now that we understand the flow, guys, don't worry about bytecode. Don't worry about bytecode. Right now, we are not in that process.


419
00:51:25.617 --> 00:51:37.397
Monal S: C is a language which is tightly coupled with RAM, that's why C++ will take that code and then provide that instruction to OS. OS will take, again, further to CPU, which will be 0101.


420
00:51:41.527 --> 00:52:00.306
Monal S: So, this is more efficient way of coding. If you check, when we go to the deep learning and better, there are a lot of libraries which are written in Python, but all of them internally use C and C++ because those are more efficient. But because those are more efficient, those are strict and hard to


421
00:52:00.307 --> 00:52:03.316
Monal S: write programs, but Python is very simple.


422
00:52:03.837 --> 00:52:07.206
Monal S: You don't have to worry about memory RAM, don't worry, okay?


423
00:52:08.147 --> 00:52:16.087
Monal S: Next part. Everyone, I will do the recap, but we have to cover this fast. It is… yes, we will be able to cover it. Final thing.


424
00:52:16.387 --> 00:52:23.437
Monal S: Final thing, then we will install, then I will do all the things, okay? There is… we have understood why Python, everyone.


425
00:52:24.927 --> 00:52:26.866
Monal S: We have understood why Python.


426
00:52:31.757 --> 00:52:34.687
Monal S: Everyone, tech, non-tech, everyone.


427
00:52:38.697 --> 00:52:40.077
Monal S: Great, great.


428
00:52:43.487 --> 00:53:00.156
Monal S: Alright? Yes, custom program we need to write in our choice of language, that's why it is a programming language. Now, programming language, as I mentioned, it gets converted. Our program written in Python gets converted to some middle language.


429
00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:07.217
Monal S: gets converted to some middle language. Now, there are different ways to convert it.


430
00:53:07.657 --> 00:53:16.637
Monal S: There are different ways to convert it. Very important, can be asked in the beginner level, Interview.


431
00:53:17.507 --> 00:53:20.227
Monal S: Compile versus…


432
00:53:25.217 --> 00:53:26.547
Monal S: interpreted.


433
00:53:30.387 --> 00:53:31.347
Monal S: Alright?


434
00:53:34.587 --> 00:53:39.106
Monal S: So, let me talk about compile, okay? Let me talk about compile.


435
00:53:39.267 --> 00:53:43.766
Monal S: Let's suppose I have a book. Okay, let's suppose I have an assignment.


436
00:53:44.847 --> 00:53:50.317
Monal S: Not assignment. Let me give you… -


437
00:53:52.757 --> 00:53:54.956
Monal S: Error, yes, that is a different thing.


438
00:53:56.237 --> 00:53:57.057
Monal S: Okay.


439
00:53:59.337 --> 00:54:03.597
Monal S: I'm just, thinking of a better example here.


440
00:54:04.437 --> 00:54:09.457
Monal S: Just give me a second, yes.


441
00:54:27.137 --> 00:54:27.987
Monal S: Alright.


442
00:54:28.197 --> 00:54:32.046
Monal S: See this. Now we have these two books.


443
00:54:32.587 --> 00:54:34.787
Monal S: Both of them are same book.


444
00:54:36.287 --> 00:54:39.337
Monal S: Okay? Both of them are same book.


445
00:54:42.037 --> 00:54:54.857
Monal S: Both of them are same book. Now let's talk about compiler. Everyone focus here. Now let's talk about compiler. What compiler does, whatever code is written here, let's suppose 100 lines of code.


446
00:54:55.027 --> 00:55:05.177
Monal S: It takes 100 lines of code, and then it starts compiling. Compiling means reading lines, and then converting it to middle language.


447
00:55:05.617 --> 00:55:11.256
Monal S: Are we clear? It combines and then converts it to a middle-level language.


448
00:55:11.987 --> 00:55:21.796
Monal S: Alright, it compiles, and then converts into a middle-level language, and then it gives you that if it is success.


449
00:55:24.147 --> 00:55:26.267
Monal S: If it is success or fail.


450
00:55:27.477 --> 00:55:37.766
Monal S: If it is success or fail. It means it reads this… it reads all of the instructions at once, everyone focus, it reads all of the instructions at once.


451
00:55:37.907 --> 00:55:39.187
Monal S: and check.


452
00:55:39.397 --> 00:55:45.506
Monal S: At the same time, whether it is compilable or not. Again, I'm telling you. See this, everyone.


453
00:55:45.637 --> 00:55:48.946
Monal S: I have told you assignment. Tell me which one is better.


454
00:55:49.087 --> 00:55:54.567
Monal S: I have given you one assignment, and this assignment, you need to write it in English.


455
00:55:55.227 --> 00:56:10.816
Monal S: You have written all the assignments, but let's suppose you are a bad student. You want to, do a little bit of fun here. Then you add a different language. Let's suppose you added French, two, three lines, then you added


456
00:56:11.707 --> 00:56:12.977
Monal S: more English.


457
00:56:13.197 --> 00:56:21.036
Monal S: And after completing all the assignments, after completing all the assignments, you are then giving it to a teacher.


458
00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:36.926
Monal S: You are then giving it to our teacher. Teacher will check, this is English correct, English correct, English correct, English correct. So you gave all the whole assignment, and teacher will check all of them, whether they are English or not.


459
00:56:37.397 --> 00:56:39.377
Monal S: Do they… all of them are English?


460
00:56:39.787 --> 00:56:41.417
Monal S: All of them are English.


461
00:56:42.167 --> 00:56:45.096
Monal S: No. Here, it will fail.


462
00:56:45.467 --> 00:56:49.627
Monal S: Here, it will fail. So the assignment… assignment task is…


463
00:56:49.837 --> 00:56:52.227
Monal S: Assignment task is success or fail.


464
00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:59.497
Monal S: Assignment task is fill. It does not match the criteria.


465
00:57:00.277 --> 00:57:01.427
Monal S: No?


466
00:57:01.637 --> 00:57:09.427
Monal S: Teacher wants to remove this way, and wants to be more optimized and correct. See this.


467
00:57:09.567 --> 00:57:18.637
Monal S: Same assignment, But this time, when a student completes one small task of the assignments, teacher checks it.


468
00:57:20.077 --> 00:57:21.976
Monal S: Teacher validates it.


469
00:57:22.397 --> 00:57:29.866
Monal S: If student writes another line, again, teacher validate. Another line, again, teacher validates. Another line, again, teacher validates.


470
00:57:30.637 --> 00:57:44.237
Monal S: Then, if student mentions a different language, teacher will validate, teacher will validate, and will mark this one as only fail, and it will not write… let it write further.


471
00:57:44.827 --> 00:57:56.997
Monal S: So, here what we are doing, here what we are doing, we are checking one by one. Here, what we are doing, we are taking all of them at once, and then check whether it is fail or success.


472
00:57:58.647 --> 00:58:08.736
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand? Here, we took all the assignment at once, and then check it. Here, we take one small part of the assignment, check one by one.


473
00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:10.817
Monal S: Everyone, say this.


474
00:58:11.257 --> 00:58:29.827
Monal S: There are different ways of submitting the assignment. In the first part, the student submitted all the tasks, all the tasks of the assignment to the teacher. Teacher checked all of them and tested whether it is fail or success. One way. Another way is teacher sat in front of the student.


475
00:58:29.887 --> 00:58:35.356
Monal S: And all the sub-tasks of the assignment, teacher is checking then and there.


476
00:58:36.657 --> 00:58:37.567
Monal S: Task.


477
00:58:37.717 --> 00:58:52.857
Monal S: Validation. Task validation. Task validation. So tell me, everyone, if an assignment is 100 subtasks, if an assignment is 100 subtasks, in the first scenario, how many times teacher will validate?


478
00:58:53.827 --> 00:58:58.347
Monal S: In the first scenario, how many times do each other we validate? Only once.


479
00:59:00.177 --> 00:59:03.687
Monal S: In the second part, how many times Streacher will validate?


480
00:59:04.967 --> 00:59:06.427
Monal S: Hundred times.


481
00:59:08.537 --> 00:59:10.396
Monal S: What is the best part here?


482
00:59:11.237 --> 00:59:12.997
Monal S: What is the best part here?


483
00:59:13.427 --> 00:59:14.676
Monal S: It is fast.


484
00:59:15.747 --> 00:59:18.696
Monal S: Yes? What is the best part here?


485
00:59:19.477 --> 00:59:21.156
Monal S: What is the best part here?


486
00:59:21.957 --> 00:59:22.907
Monal S: Tell me!


487
00:59:27.317 --> 00:59:29.797
Monal S: Correct. Quake feedback.


488
00:59:31.507 --> 00:59:34.597
Monal S: But the negative part is, it is slow.


489
00:59:35.087 --> 00:59:37.247
Monal S: Here, are we getting quick feedback?


490
00:59:37.627 --> 00:59:40.526
Monal S: Here, are we getting quick feedback? No.


491
00:59:41.337 --> 00:59:44.966
Monal S: So, it is hard to change yes or no.


492
00:59:46.047 --> 00:59:55.286
Monal S: Now, if the student… if the student needs to change something in the assignment, they have to do it again. But here, if something is wrong, they can fix it then and there, yes or no.


493
00:59:55.697 --> 00:59:57.377
Monal S: Then and there, yes or no?


494
00:59:58.407 --> 01:00:02.447
Monal S: This is called as… this is how compiler works.


495
01:00:04.077 --> 01:00:10.327
Monal S: This is how compiler works, this is how interpreter works.


496
01:00:11.267 --> 01:00:12.897
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


497
01:00:14.127 --> 01:00:15.887
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


498
01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:28.676
Monal S: and Python… Python originally was interpreter, Python originally was…


499
01:00:29.947 --> 01:00:34.887
Monal S: Interpreter, but now it also does… it also combines both.


500
01:00:35.887 --> 01:00:42.096
Monal S: It combines both interpreter and interpreter and compiler to do it efficiently.


501
01:00:43.627 --> 01:00:54.386
Monal S: So, interpreter, when we write a code, see this? When I write a code like this, print something, I write another code. Suppose each of them is a new line.


502
01:00:54.587 --> 01:00:57.307
Monal S: Suppose each of them is a new line.


503
01:01:00.527 --> 01:01:03.347
Monal S: Tell me where you are able to see the mistake.


504
01:01:03.477 --> 01:01:08.207
Monal S: Code 1, 2, 3, 4. Tell me where you were able to see something wrong.


505
01:01:08.487 --> 01:01:19.806
Monal S: In three, if Python is a whole compiler, it will take all of them at once and try to convert to middle-level language and validate it.


506
01:01:20.247 --> 01:01:33.906
Monal S: Only after writing all four, let's suppose we took 4 hours. For each line, we took 1 hour. We wrote all of them in 4 hours, but here is a mistake, now what I have to do? I have to again go back and fix it.


507
01:01:34.637 --> 01:01:48.206
Monal S: But in terms of… in terms of interpreter, what I will do? I will write this code, validate. Write code, validate. Two hours are already done. Write code, validate. Error comes. I will fix here.


508
01:01:49.237 --> 01:01:53.836
Monal S: Did I waste it more time? Did I waste it more time? No.


509
01:01:55.837 --> 01:02:14.277
Monal S: But if everything is correct, compiler will do what? Will compile all of them in a single go, so that it can now communicate with OS directly. So if everything is correct, and if you're doing it, compiler converts all of them in single, and is usually fast.


510
01:02:14.677 --> 01:02:21.976
Monal S: But, in terms of this flexibility that we have in interpreter, that is, quick feedback, we don't have it in interpreter.


511
01:02:22.757 --> 01:02:24.327
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


512
01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:28.357
Monal S: Is everyone clear? Everyone means everyone.


513
01:02:28.847 --> 01:02:35.457
Monal S: Guys, I'm teaching you at a very small level. Now, how many of you are doubting that all of this were unnecessary?


514
01:02:35.697 --> 01:02:38.806
Monal S: How many of you think that all of this was unnecessary?


515
01:02:41.407 --> 01:02:43.237
Monal S: Was it unnecessary?


516
01:02:46.957 --> 01:02:51.117
Monal S: It is giving you a bigger picture, Everyone is able to connect?


517
01:02:54.117 --> 01:02:55.007
Monal S: Alright?


518
01:02:56.537 --> 01:03:08.657
Monal S: Alright? That's great. Alright? Now we are jumping to, finally, Python, where we will do some of the installation, but before that, next thing is on the Python. Guys, we are finally in Python.


519
01:03:08.887 --> 01:03:18.037
Monal S: We are finally in Python, alright? So Python is what? Tell me, everyone, Python is what? Python is a programming language.


520
01:03:19.487 --> 01:03:22.427
Monal S: programming language. It's a language!


521
01:03:23.177 --> 01:03:24.757
Monal S: It's a language.


522
01:03:25.517 --> 01:03:26.397
Monal S: Okay?


523
01:03:26.867 --> 01:03:29.497
Monal S: Let me just check how old Python is.


524
01:03:32.957 --> 01:03:39.087
Monal S: Okay, I checked on Google, Python is around 33 years old.


525
01:03:40.367 --> 01:03:48.176
Monal S: Okay? Python is around 33 years old. Now, tell me which version of operating system everyone is using in their phone.


526
01:03:48.637 --> 01:03:53.566
Monal S: How many of you remember that? Which version of operating system you are using in your phone?


527
01:03:53.867 --> 01:04:01.137
Monal S: operating system for Android people. Some might be using Android 15, Android 16,


528
01:04:01.867 --> 01:04:10.887
Monal S: for iOS people, some might be using 26, Some might be using… Others, yes or no?


529
01:04:12.707 --> 01:04:19.036
Monal S: But tell me… Before 3 years, does this iOS 26 exist? Yes or no?


530
01:04:20.797 --> 01:04:28.917
Monal S: Do you think this version exists? No. So, every year, we get a new year, new version. Yes or no? Yes or no?


531
01:04:30.497 --> 01:04:44.297
Monal S: Every year, we get a new, better, and more optimized version. Similarly, in 33 years, Python have different, different versions. And the current version of Python that we have is… let me show you…


532
01:04:48.397 --> 01:04:58.357
Monal S: I'm just checking if we don't have any new version or not. Okay, the current version of Python is 3.14.0. Okay, we already have 3.14.2.


533
01:04:58.837 --> 01:05:03.157
Monal S: I started learning Python when the Python had 3.4.


534
01:05:03.487 --> 01:05:12.146
Monal S: Then in 3.4, it is like that, 3.5, 3.6, and all of them have different, different versions inside it as well.


535
01:05:12.937 --> 01:05:15.597
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand versions now?


536
01:05:19.237 --> 01:05:20.197
Monal S: Yes?


537
01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:25.957
Monal S: So, next thing is, now that Python has different, different versions.


538
01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:36.116
Monal S: Python has different, different versions. Now we need to… we need a way to manage versions. You can now go to Python website, see this?


539
01:05:36.217 --> 01:05:47.206
Monal S: You can now go to Python, I will show you. Don't, don't do it. If you write Python, you will see this page of python.org, and here you will see downloads.


540
01:05:47.467 --> 01:06:08.376
Monal S: If you click on download, you can see Python 3.27, it is already end of life at around 2019. Not 19, it is somewhere else, something else, okay? But you can see now it is Python 3.15. It is now in a feature branch. Don't worry about all of these words which I'm using. But you can download any of this Python, you can download any of this Python.


541
01:06:08.377 --> 01:06:10.267
Monal S: And you can install it.


542
01:06:10.267 --> 01:06:14.327
Monal S: But you will be installing only 3.10, yes?


543
01:06:14.517 --> 01:06:17.776
Monal S: If you click on something and install, you will only install one.


544
01:06:18.937 --> 01:06:29.727
Monal S: Yes, but because we are doing coding, everyone, because we are doing coding, with the help of code, what we create? With the help of code, we create project.


545
01:06:29.947 --> 01:06:34.637
Monal S: And project is nothing but… Set of tasks.


546
01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:36.686
Monal S: Which does something.


547
01:06:37.547 --> 01:06:45.996
Monal S: Yes? Let's suppose you are creating project in 2020. The project is written with Python 3.6.


548
01:06:47.377 --> 01:06:58.546
Monal S: Now you are working in another project, it is year 2026, and you are working in Python 3.14, just for an example. Just for an example.


549
01:06:59.097 --> 01:07:04.176
Monal S: Do we require multiple versions to work in both of the projects?


550
01:07:04.457 --> 01:07:10.557
Monal S: Tell me, do we require multiple Python here to work in both of the projects? Yes!


551
01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:16.706
Monal S: This project is working with 3.6. This project is working in 3.14.


552
01:07:17.846 --> 01:07:35.747
Monal S: the code is a little different. They changed a few versions, guys. If you check, how many of you remember that some of the applications from 2014 or 15, or 20, if you install in your current operating system, it will say, app not supported, or update the app, yes or no?


553
01:07:36.587 --> 01:07:37.817
Monal S: Yes or no?


554
01:07:38.617 --> 01:07:40.216
Monal S: It does that. Why?


555
01:07:40.537 --> 01:07:44.726
Monal S: Because some things are changed, now it is not backward compatible.


556
01:07:45.596 --> 01:07:50.006
Monal S: That app was not compatible with the latest version.


557
01:07:50.646 --> 01:07:54.256
Monal S: Yes? So, what is our need here?


558
01:07:54.667 --> 01:07:58.356
Monal S: Tell me what is our need here. We're just talking about need, guys.


559
01:07:58.726 --> 01:08:00.697
Monal S: We are just talking about our need here.


560
01:08:03.957 --> 01:08:06.916
Monal S: What is our need? Think about it. What is our need?


561
01:08:11.226 --> 01:08:16.087
Monal S: in your system, guys, if you have Instagram in your system.


562
01:08:18.987 --> 01:08:24.366
Monal S: If you have Instagram in your mobile app, can you install to Instagram normally?


563
01:08:25.207 --> 01:08:27.807
Monal S: Can you install to Instagram normally?


564
01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:41.276
Monal S: If you install latest version of Instagram, let's suppose version 20, that is, you have 2026, you go onto web, and then you install a version 1. Very old.


565
01:08:41.687 --> 01:08:45.227
Monal S: Will Instagram run your system? No, it will break.


566
01:08:46.317 --> 01:09:01.596
Monal S: So, at a time in our system to work… to… for that application to work normally, we require… we require the stable version. But in coding, in coding, we work… we work on multiple projects.


567
01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:13.857
Monal S: In coding, we work on project A simultaneously, project B, project C, project D, project E. We work with multiple projects. So what we require is everyone able to understand the problem statement?


568
01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:21.457
Monal S: If we install multiple versions of Python in our system directly, it will break, it might have an issue.


569
01:09:22.237 --> 01:09:24.716
Monal S: So, is everyone clear with the issue?


570
01:09:25.367 --> 01:09:35.636
Monal S: Our issue is, we need a way to manage… Projects… but project of different Python.


571
01:09:36.147 --> 01:09:47.817
Monal S: Projects, Manage projects, Off… different… Python version.


572
01:09:49.497 --> 01:09:50.507
Monal S: Yes?


573
01:09:51.177 --> 01:09:58.237
Monal S: manage project of different Python version. We require a way. We have Python, but the problem statement is something different.


574
01:09:58.357 --> 01:10:01.516
Monal S: We need to manage our project for different Python version.


575
01:10:01.737 --> 01:10:06.037
Monal S: And that's where a concept called as virtual environment.


576
01:10:08.447 --> 01:10:10.967
Monal S: Virtual environment comes.


577
01:10:12.097 --> 01:10:22.886
Monal S: Alright? Virtual environment. So, with the help of a concept called as virtual environment, in Python, we already have a solution, we call it as VENV.


578
01:10:23.107 --> 01:10:36.916
Monal S: Virtual, ENV means environment. Using virtual environment in the same operating system, we can create multi… we can install and handle multiple Python projects as well.


579
01:10:38.947 --> 01:10:40.677
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


580
01:10:42.217 --> 01:10:43.827
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


581
01:10:44.787 --> 01:10:47.176
Monal S: This is virtual environment.


582
01:10:50.197 --> 01:10:53.287
Monal S: Alright, this is the solution.


583
01:10:54.467 --> 01:11:03.916
Monal S: Alright? Now, you can have virtual environment directly from Python, or you can use other package managers. Guys, there are softwares.


584
01:11:04.267 --> 01:11:17.997
Monal S: There are softwares which helps us do this particular part, install virtual environment, install multiple versions of Python more efficiently. There are different kinds of software for that. One of them is called as Conda.


585
01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:24.177
Monal S: One of them is… Python VENV.


586
01:11:24.517 --> 01:11:33.467
Monal S: Alright? One of them is… let's remove the conda from here. One of them is Anaconda, one of them is latest, one is UV. UV.


587
01:11:34.247 --> 01:11:40.037
Monal S: All of these are… Package managers.


588
01:11:41.827 --> 01:11:49.497
Monal S: They help us package the environments, manage the environments, manage different projects efficiently.


589
01:11:50.377 --> 01:11:51.827
Monal S: Are we clear?


590
01:11:52.897 --> 01:11:54.497
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


591
01:11:55.207 --> 01:11:57.137
Monal S: These are softwares.


592
01:11:59.067 --> 01:12:01.186
Monal S: Alright, these are softwares.


593
01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:03.236
Monal S: Guys, wait a second, okay?


594
01:12:33.837 --> 01:12:34.607
Monal S: Alright.


595
01:12:34.867 --> 01:12:36.976
Monal S: So, is everyone able to understand?


596
01:12:37.347 --> 01:12:38.537
Monal S: Hi, everyone!


597
01:12:40.417 --> 01:12:54.477
Monal S: Great. We require a software which can handle all of this, and this is the software which we are going to work. Before this software again, I need to tell you one final thing. Let's first review what are the tools which we have seen today. Tools.


598
01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:59.216
Monal S: So guys, tools, what tools we have seen first, what was the first tool?


599
01:12:59.557 --> 01:13:00.767
Monal S: Terminal.


600
01:13:01.387 --> 01:13:05.407
Monal S: Terminal is a tool to communicate with Python or OS.


601
01:13:06.047 --> 01:13:09.107
Monal S: It provides instruction to our operating system.


602
01:13:10.137 --> 01:13:17.446
Monal S: Okay? Using terminal, we can open Python, because Python is installed in our operating system, yes?


603
01:13:17.557 --> 01:13:24.496
Monal S: But Terminal is not Python. Using Terminal, we can open Python, so it's a tool to communicate with the OS.


604
01:13:24.747 --> 01:13:28.147
Monal S: Alright? We needed a programming language.


605
01:13:30.617 --> 01:13:37.286
Monal S: We needed a programming language, and which is… which is the one programming language which we are going to use for data science?


606
01:13:39.117 --> 01:13:43.807
Monal S: Which programming language? Python is the one which we had picked.


607
01:13:45.277 --> 01:13:51.147
Monal S: We require another tool to manage multiple versions of Python for different projects.


608
01:13:53.467 --> 01:13:56.177
Monal S: We wanted a project manager.


609
01:13:56.907 --> 01:13:59.197
Monal S: What is the tool which we have seen?


610
01:13:59.997 --> 01:14:03.057
Monal S: We have seen UV and Conda.


611
01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:16.406
Monal S: Okay? But we are going to go with UV, guys. Conda and others, I will tell you later. Okay? UV is one of that tool which will help us do project manager and other things, which we will understand later. And UV internally uses…


612
01:14:16.517 --> 01:14:22.126
Monal S: V-E-N-V, which helps us manage environment, but UV is the main tool.


613
01:14:22.477 --> 01:14:23.866
Monal S: Are we clear?


614
01:14:24.257 --> 01:14:25.576
Monal S: Are we clear?


615
01:14:25.777 --> 01:14:37.037
Monal S: Now we have a way to communicate to OS, now we have a way to write our programs. We have a way to handle the project, but one important thing is still left.


616
01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:42.207
Monal S: How are we going to write the code, and where?


617
01:14:43.987 --> 01:14:49.597
Monal S: Guys, I will talk about everything, full form and everything. I will show you. Where are we going to write the code?


618
01:14:51.337 --> 01:14:57.787
Monal S: We can write the code in terminal also, but again, it is kind of hard.


619
01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:10.357
Monal S: Operating system coding was hard, that's why we created something called as programming language to make it simple to provide the instruction. Now, we can also write code in terminal, but again, it is hard.


620
01:15:10.727 --> 01:15:16.137
Monal S: So what we require, again, we will come back and look for tool.


621
01:15:16.267 --> 01:15:19.617
Monal S: How many of you know the tool called as Notepad?


622
01:15:19.907 --> 01:15:21.996
Monal S: In Windows, it is Notepad.


623
01:15:22.647 --> 01:15:26.407
Monal S: In Windows, it is Notepad. In…


624
01:15:26.617 --> 01:15:32.756
Monal S: Macos, you will see… guys, in macOS, what is the one tool that you have? Where you write just text.


625
01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:37.746
Monal S: Rich text, Rich text.


626
01:15:38.487 --> 01:15:45.677
Monal S: Notes… notes is where we write notes, but we cannot save the file as .txt or something. So if I show you my notepad.


627
01:15:47.597 --> 01:15:48.677
Monal S: Say this.


628
01:15:52.367 --> 01:15:54.457
Monal S: This is how Notepad looks like.


629
01:15:55.257 --> 01:15:56.277
Monal S: Yes?


630
01:15:56.677 --> 01:16:06.156
Monal S: Text edit is also there in Mac, okay? Here we write something. Everyone, here we write something, we can save something as well.


631
01:16:06.897 --> 01:16:13.807
Monal S: Okay, let me write text edit, because people are saying text edit. We also have… Text edit.


632
01:16:15.457 --> 01:16:19.246
Monal S: Am I able to write something? Am I able to write something?


633
01:16:20.377 --> 01:16:25.397
Monal S: Is it giving me a better flexibility than terminal, everyone?


634
01:16:26.547 --> 01:16:27.547
Monal S: Yes?


635
01:16:29.197 --> 01:16:31.617
Monal S: Yes, I can save it.


636
01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:33.527
Monal S: I can save it.


637
01:16:33.787 --> 01:16:36.166
Monal S: In hay, I'm going to save it as…


638
01:16:36.987 --> 01:16:41.407
Monal S: hello.py. I will tell you later what is .py, but I can save it.


639
01:16:41.877 --> 01:16:42.847
Monal S: Save.


640
01:16:42.977 --> 01:16:46.186
Monal S: My code is saved. I can again edit it.


641
01:16:46.677 --> 01:16:51.486
Monal S: Yes? So, this is a tool where I can write a code.


642
01:16:51.857 --> 01:17:01.227
Monal S: Alright, this is a tool where I can write a code. A tool… Which helps us write… Update.


643
01:17:02.187 --> 01:17:03.847
Monal S: Create a file.


644
01:17:04.607 --> 01:17:12.076
Monal S: and delete. Not delete, delete is operating system, but create, update, write, or you can say, let's say, delete also.


645
01:17:12.257 --> 01:17:13.057
Monal S: Okay.


646
01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:19.516
Monal S: For now, I'm seeing all of that. A tool that does it, where we can write, update, we call those as…


647
01:17:21.907 --> 01:17:23.247
Monal S: Editors.


648
01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:29.117
Monal S: Editor. These are tools which helps us do editing.


649
01:17:30.057 --> 01:17:34.857
Monal S: Priyam, I told you Project Manager will help us manage different versions of Python.


650
01:17:36.817 --> 01:17:40.377
Monal S: Alright? Different versions of Python, it will help us manage. Alright, Priam?


651
01:17:40.827 --> 01:17:44.527
Monal S: In a same system. Is everyone able to understand what is editors?


652
01:17:44.917 --> 01:17:47.446
Monal S: Is everyone able to understand what is editors?


653
01:17:48.717 --> 01:17:49.647
Monal S: Alright.


654
01:17:49.997 --> 01:17:53.967
Monal S: Now, I will show you one more tool, and tell me which one is better.


655
01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:01.947
Monal S: Just give me a second, let me open it, let me open the final thing.


656
01:18:12.477 --> 01:18:14.357
Monal S: Tell me which one is better.


657
01:18:14.937 --> 01:18:16.027
Monal S: This one?


658
01:18:17.617 --> 01:18:20.237
Monal S: Or this one. Which one looks better?


659
01:18:20.627 --> 01:18:23.016
Monal S: Just from the looks of it, which one looks better?


660
01:18:25.577 --> 01:18:28.896
Monal S: Which one looks more user-friendly?


661
01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:35.697
Monal S: Which one is more user-friendly? This new tool? This new tool which I opened?


662
01:18:36.477 --> 01:18:39.096
Monal S: Here, you can see I have a lot of functionalities.


663
01:18:39.557 --> 01:18:47.996
Monal S: Here you can see the code that I'm writing. Anything that I'm writing is getting highlighted, it is intelligent. Don't worry about the code. It is intelligent.


664
01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:57.656
Monal S: Is it giving me more things?


665
01:18:58.127 --> 01:19:06.826
Monal S: Is it giving me more things, more functionality, as you can see on the screen? It is reading everything. But here, are we able to get anything?


666
01:19:08.027 --> 01:19:08.967
Monal S: Here.


667
01:19:11.617 --> 01:19:14.277
Monal S: Are we able to get anything? No.


668
01:19:14.687 --> 01:19:23.637
Monal S: So, this is a tool that is called as IDE. So, IDE is a tool which will help us write code again.


669
01:19:24.017 --> 01:19:29.637
Monal S: It will help us do ride, update.


670
01:19:30.337 --> 01:19:34.137
Monal S: Create, delete. Basic things it also has.


671
01:19:34.397 --> 01:19:46.426
Monal S: It also has ability to run the code To debug the code, extensions… Plus, more functionalities.


672
01:19:49.637 --> 01:19:51.297
Monal S: Which one is better?


673
01:19:52.117 --> 01:20:01.587
Monal S: Option 1 or option 2? Which one is better? Obviously, the more, the better. This one is called as IDE. IDE, full form is…


674
01:20:02.587 --> 01:20:09.427
Monal S: integrated… Development. Environment.


675
01:20:12.177 --> 01:20:21.867
Monal S: It means… In this editor, we have development functionalities. You can see integrated development environment on where?


676
01:20:22.167 --> 01:20:27.977
Monal S: On editors, if we have development tools, it will make it as an IDEA.


677
01:20:29.477 --> 01:20:31.047
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


678
01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:45.706
Monal S: So, in our course, we are going to use IDE a lot. There are different kinds of IDEs. One very, lightweight, okay? One very lightweight, and also free, is called as VS Code.


679
01:20:47.047 --> 01:20:49.496
Monal S: V as code, which I just showed you.


680
01:20:49.647 --> 01:21:00.956
Monal S: Here, you can see, I can create a new file, I can write whatever I want, and then do something here, save the file, close it, save the file, close it, and also, see everyone!


681
01:21:01.517 --> 01:21:04.397
Monal S: Using terminal, I run everything.


682
01:21:04.597 --> 01:21:07.876
Monal S: Using terminal, I can run everything. Arpith, I will tell you.


683
01:21:08.187 --> 01:21:11.697
Monal S: If I go here, see these triple dots?


684
01:21:12.157 --> 01:21:13.657
Monal S: Click on Terminal.


685
01:21:13.917 --> 01:21:17.347
Monal S: Are we able to see the terminal which we saw before?


686
01:21:17.547 --> 01:21:19.177
Monal S: Same kind of a thing.


687
01:21:19.767 --> 01:21:24.326
Monal S: See this? Here, I have functions here, I can open a lot of things. Here, you can see.


688
01:21:25.857 --> 01:21:27.437
Monal S: I have a lot of things here.


689
01:21:27.827 --> 01:21:33.087
Monal S: Similarly, if I open Terminal here, at least in Windows, are we able to see other things?


690
01:21:33.207 --> 01:21:37.596
Monal S: Plus, plus, same kind of a… similar, similar kind of a view, yes?


691
01:21:38.447 --> 01:21:41.366
Monal S: I can delete, I can delete more.


692
01:21:43.977 --> 01:21:44.947
Monal S: Serious.


693
01:21:45.527 --> 01:21:49.636
Monal S: command prompt. Similarly, command prompt, I was able to see here.


694
01:21:50.107 --> 01:21:58.636
Monal S: See? Command prompt. Yes? Just a different view, but it is same. If I write… see this? If I write CD,


695
01:21:59.307 --> 01:22:00.966
Monal S: Is it working same?


696
01:22:03.767 --> 01:22:05.347
Monal S: Is it working same?


697
01:22:07.027 --> 01:22:10.456
Monal S: Yes, because it is the same program.


698
01:22:10.767 --> 01:22:20.126
Monal S: Because it is the same program. So, now conclude everything about the tools, and then move forward. So, what is VS Code?


699
01:22:20.967 --> 01:22:23.047
Monal S: VS Code is nothing but…


700
01:22:23.207 --> 01:22:32.466
Monal S: your editor, it helps you edit, plus it helps you do your development better, because it gives you more functionality.


701
01:22:33.577 --> 01:22:35.057
Monal S: This is via score.


702
01:22:35.387 --> 01:22:40.736
Monal S: This is our operating system. VS Code runs on our operating system.


703
01:22:43.067 --> 01:22:47.066
Monal S: Our operating system has a tool called as Terminal.


704
01:22:47.477 --> 01:22:58.236
Monal S: And VS Code does not have its own terminal. VS Code uses our operating system terminal only, and we can see the same terminal in the same application.


705
01:22:58.897 --> 01:23:11.917
Monal S: So we don't have to open terminal separately to run something. Is everyone clear? The terminal is not of VS Code? VS Code borrows the terminal of the OS so that we can see in the same application


706
01:23:13.527 --> 01:23:15.087
Monal S: Is everyone clear?


707
01:23:17.637 --> 01:23:19.227
Monal S: Now, tell me…


708
01:23:19.997 --> 01:23:29.777
Monal S: Is VS Code programming language? No. VS Code is just an editor. VS Code helps you edit, write code, and develop code.


709
01:23:30.337 --> 01:23:34.126
Monal S: VS… using VS Code, we can write Python code as well.


710
01:23:34.647 --> 01:23:38.036
Monal S: Using VS Code, we can write Python code as well.


711
01:23:39.137 --> 01:23:40.227
Monal S: But…


712
01:23:41.197 --> 01:23:48.517
Monal S: Guys, if I have an image, image gets opened with MP3 player, or image gets opened with gallery. Tell me.


713
01:23:49.337 --> 01:23:54.426
Monal S: If I talk about image, image gets opened with MP3 player or gallery.


714
01:23:54.967 --> 01:24:04.647
Monal S: gallery. Similarly, the code which is written in Python will only be able to run with VS Code or with Python… with Python software.


715
01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:15.036
Monal S: See, things that are written in Python will only be executed with Python software. So, in VS Code, you have terminal.


716
01:24:15.277 --> 01:24:23.196
Monal S: VS Code also has development tools, which we will see later. VS Code borrows functionality of Python software.


717
01:24:24.027 --> 01:24:31.637
Monal S: Okay? Let me write it better, because I think I'm going fast, and it is making my writing bad. Okay?


718
01:24:34.127 --> 01:24:36.417
Monal S: Python software.


719
01:24:37.227 --> 01:24:43.326
Monal S: So VS Code will borrow our Python installed in our system.


720
01:24:43.527 --> 01:24:57.987
Monal S: to run the application, and also we can run Python application with the terminal in the VS Code, or the terminal outside of it. We will see it later. But is everyone able to understand the flow of the tools that we have?


721
01:24:58.107 --> 01:25:04.257
Monal S: Guys, VS Code is an editor using VS Code. You can just write C++, C, Java, any code.


722
01:25:04.367 --> 01:25:08.677
Monal S: But to run C++, do we require Python or Java?


723
01:25:08.807 --> 01:25:21.296
Monal S: or C++. To run C++, we need to have C++. To run Python, we need to have Python. To run something, VS Code is nothing but an editor which helps us do development fast.


724
01:25:21.937 --> 01:25:27.107
Monal S: And it borrows the functionality of other things, so we can do our work in a single place.


725
01:25:28.127 --> 01:25:30.057
Monal S: In a single place.


726
01:25:30.527 --> 01:25:43.556
Monal S: So here we have terminal, here we have our notepad, and if I write something, it also gives you some suggestion, which is a part of IDE. You can see, all of these functions, other things, it is a part of IDE.


727
01:25:46.327 --> 01:25:57.727
Monal S: So now we understand all the flow. Now, let's head over to the installation, and I will show you, okay? So guys, tell me, what is the difference between IDE and VS Code? I just told you.


728
01:25:58.417 --> 01:26:00.986
Monal S: What is the difference between ID and VS Code?


729
01:26:03.337 --> 01:26:05.327
Monal S: VS Code is an IDE!


730
01:26:06.547 --> 01:26:11.327
Monal S: They are not same. VS Code is a type of IDE in


731
01:26:11.707 --> 01:26:21.916
Monal S: There are different kinds, just like we have different mobile phones, just like iPhone 15, iPhone 14, VS Code is one of the IDE, we have PyCharm.


732
01:26:22.197 --> 01:26:25.226
Monal S: We have Spyder, these are different, different tools.


733
01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:41.106
Monal S: But PyCharm is heavy, Spyder is also heavy, VS Code is very light, that's why a lot of developers use it. Now we have AI ID as well, the advanced IDE called as Cursor. If you follow Krishna on YouTube, you might have seen Google Anti-Gravity.


734
01:26:43.337 --> 01:26:47.957
Monal S: These are nothing but your ID where you write code and it will help you develop things.


735
01:26:48.507 --> 01:26:50.267
Monal S: Are we… are we clear?


736
01:26:50.967 --> 01:27:02.557
Monal S: Lightweight means it… VS Code might use 40MB of RAM, PyCharm, PyCharm might use 1.4GB.


737
01:27:02.697 --> 01:27:07.236
Monal S: PyCharm might provide you 50 more functionalities than VS Code.


738
01:27:07.567 --> 01:27:13.227
Monal S: But if you don't need that functionality, will you use VS Code to run, or PyCharm?


739
01:27:13.907 --> 01:27:19.557
Monal S: Tell me… If you don't require this functionality, you will still use VS Code.


740
01:27:20.497 --> 01:27:26.046
Monal S: PyCharm is good for more development if you want to go more advanced things, but for now, we don't require it.


741
01:27:26.267 --> 01:27:42.047
Monal S: Is everyone clear what is lightweight? Guys, in industry, developers also use VS Code, also use PyCharm. Both of them, PyCharm gives you more things. It can do all the job of VS Code, but VS Code has more functionality, which I will show you. Extensions and other things.


742
01:27:42.967 --> 01:27:45.247
Monal S: Is everyone clear about his lightweight?


743
01:27:50.327 --> 01:28:00.427
Monal S: Okay, someone asked me a good question, that why we cannot just use Python software? Why to use VS Code? I will… I will show you. See this.


744
01:28:05.087 --> 01:28:09.566
Monal S: Everyone, say this. I will start the Python, I already have Python in my system.


745
01:28:10.737 --> 01:28:13.877
Monal S: I will write Python. In your system, it will not work.


746
01:28:14.507 --> 01:28:23.306
Monal S: Here, I have to write code. Whatever code I will write, see, this error is coming. Do you like this place? Here you can run only one code at a time.


747
01:28:23.787 --> 01:28:30.456
Monal S: But here, you can do whatever you want. You have terminal here. Which one is better?


748
01:28:30.567 --> 01:28:32.307
Monal S: Here, you can also write code.


749
01:28:33.257 --> 01:28:36.157
Monal S: This is interpreter. See this, one line at a time.


750
01:28:37.707 --> 01:28:42.537
Monal S: Guys, you can totally do coding here, but it is not that user-friendly.


751
01:28:43.077 --> 01:28:44.636
Monal S: At least not to me.


752
01:28:46.017 --> 01:28:47.166
Monal S: Are we clear?


753
01:28:48.067 --> 01:28:50.837
Monal S: Guys, Jupiter is also there, Jupiter is for something else.


754
01:28:50.987 --> 01:28:58.837
Monal S: Is everyone clear on the whole concept? Guys, as I told you, we… is everyone clear on tools? Why?


755
01:28:59.087 --> 01:29:06.166
Monal S: Everyone, tools, why, and computers, is everyone confident now? Non-tech people is also on the same page.


756
01:29:07.457 --> 01:29:09.536
Monal S: Guys, how are you liking today's session?


757
01:29:10.097 --> 01:29:12.826
Monal S: Great session, good session, bad session.


758
01:29:13.757 --> 01:29:16.117
Monal S: A special announcement there, but installation.


759
01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.267
Monal S: Interesting.


760
01:29:22.927 --> 01:29:40.866
Monal S: Alright? Now, see this, everyone? I will just show you. You guys can try it, because we don't have a lot of time. You guys can try it, it is not at all hard. Just see the recording, because installation and everything, we cannot do it in a single class. Alright? If you guys are able to do it, it's fine. Otherwise, we will take the doubt at that other time. But see this?


761
01:29:41.817 --> 01:29:44.357
Monal S: We don't have to install Python.


762
01:29:44.487 --> 01:29:48.156
Monal S: What we will do, guys, the first download, I will even focus on the screen.


763
01:29:48.617 --> 01:29:56.517
Monal S: Write VS Code in Google, write VS Code in Google, press enter, you will see the first link, VS Code.


764
01:29:57.807 --> 01:30:00.827
Monal S: Click on the first link, and here you will see download.


765
01:30:01.147 --> 01:30:02.157
Monal S: Everyone?


766
01:30:03.047 --> 01:30:04.177
Monal S: Download.


767
01:30:07.657 --> 01:30:13.766
Monal S: Tauraj, as I mentioned, text editor only lets you edit and write code, but does not provide more functionality. We want better.


768
01:30:16.287 --> 01:30:25.226
Monal S: Yes. And guys, click on download, and the download will… it will go to this page. Is everyone able to see the same page? You will be able to see.


769
01:30:25.727 --> 01:30:31.916
Monal S: Based on your operating system, and based on the chip, you should know about your computer, or at least do a little bit of homework.


770
01:30:32.077 --> 01:30:33.107
Monal S: Okay?


771
01:30:33.117 --> 01:30:46.816
Monal S: User installer system, we have installed, we have Zip, we have other system. This is for Linux, this is for Mac. If you have Intel chip, click on this one. If you have Apple Silicon, that is M1, M2, M3 chip, click on Apple Silicon.


772
01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:58.036
Monal S: Otherwise, go with Universal, it is for both. Here, we have Windows. I have Windows in my system. I'm going to click on the System Installer. Guys, I want to click on System Installer.


773
01:30:58.307 --> 01:31:06.487
Monal S: Deepak, I personally like VS Code, okay? You can… in later, we will introduce you more things. Cursor and other things, but not now.


774
01:31:07.217 --> 01:31:11.926
Monal S: We don't have to use just one, we can use multiple. So I will click on Act 64,


775
01:31:12.317 --> 01:31:23.236
Monal S: Alright, and it will start downloading. See this? It is starting downloading. In the meantime, this is the first tool which is downloading. Second thing is, guys, not PyChump, not now.


776
01:31:23.307 --> 01:31:42.607
Monal S: Second thing is UV Package Manager. Go to inter… go to Google.com and search UV UV Package Manager. Here, you will see the main company which made UV, Astral Docs. Click on this link, Installation UV Astral Docs, and click here.


777
01:31:43.067 --> 01:31:47.826
Monal S: Danesh, because it is fast, it manages a lot of things for you, it removes that pain.


778
01:31:49.177 --> 01:31:51.807
Monal S: It helps us a lot. You will see later.


779
01:31:51.927 --> 01:31:55.246
Monal S: Once we progress more, you will see the power of UV.


780
01:31:55.577 --> 01:32:01.267
Monal S: Is everyone able to see Mac OS and Linux and Windows? If you have Mac OS,


781
01:32:01.737 --> 01:32:07.886
Monal S: Copy this command, copy this command, open your terminal in macOS. Guys, I'm talking about macOS.


782
01:32:08.137 --> 01:32:09.997
Monal S: And paste it here.


783
01:32:10.787 --> 01:32:24.346
Monal S: and press enter. In my system, it will not work because I'm in Windows. It will not work. Open your terminal and paste this command, alright? And press Enter. I don't have it, it will not work on my system.


784
01:32:24.507 --> 01:32:30.697
Monal S: Alright? In your system, for Windows people, you will go to the Windows tab. There is Windows.


785
01:32:31.947 --> 01:32:35.577
Monal S: Go to Windows, and here you will see PowerShell.


786
01:32:35.857 --> 01:32:36.817
Monal S: Yes?


787
01:32:37.407 --> 01:32:42.176
Monal S: Guys, why we are focused on Jupyter? It will be… you will be able to install everything.


788
01:32:44.877 --> 01:32:47.256
Monal S: Jupyter is not a package manager.


789
01:32:49.237 --> 01:32:53.387
Monal S: Jupyter is… Jupyter gives you notebook and other things, it's not a package manager.


790
01:32:53.647 --> 01:32:59.667
Monal S: So guys, for Windows, copy this command, and in your terminal, open terminal.


791
01:33:00.977 --> 01:33:02.776
Monal S: Guys, it will not make a difference.


792
01:33:03.217 --> 01:33:18.516
Monal S: And you can see this is command prompt, this is not what we want. It showed PowerShell, so click here, and click on the first one that is Windows PowerShell. If you don't have this, in search, directly search PowerShell.


793
01:33:18.807 --> 01:33:21.076
Monal S: it will give you Windows PowerShell.


794
01:33:22.357 --> 01:33:32.487
Monal S: Paste the command which you copied from the website, let me close it, paste it, and press enter. I already have UV, you can see it is now downloading different UV.


795
01:33:32.687 --> 01:33:35.166
Monal S: UV is installed in my system now.


796
01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:39.007
Monal S: Close everything.


797
01:33:40.127 --> 01:33:46.616
Monal S: Guys, Miniconda is also fine, you don't require it, but UV will be faster for other things, and also lightweight.


798
01:33:48.627 --> 01:33:54.117
Monal S: PowerShell, guys, for people who pasted, someone pasted me this one, see this?


799
01:33:57.917 --> 01:34:02.366
Monal S: I'm not… it is not about targeting, it is about showing what we should not do.


800
01:34:02.627 --> 01:34:10.677
Monal S: If you're getting this error in Windows, if you're getting this error in Windows, what is that error? Let me copy, if I can copy.


801
01:34:14.367 --> 01:34:19.766
Monal S: Someone is getting this error when running. It means you are not running in PowerShell.


802
01:34:20.637 --> 01:34:24.847
Monal S: You are running in somewhere else. Run in PowerShell only.


803
01:34:26.877 --> 01:34:34.466
Monal S: Alright? Any errors we will solve later, but make sure that you are in PowerShell in Windows. How many Mac people is able to do it?


804
01:34:35.017 --> 01:34:39.566
Monal S: How many Mac people, when they pasted this command, is able to run it?


805
01:34:40.537 --> 01:34:41.527
Monal S: Done?


806
01:34:43.447 --> 01:34:52.156
Monal S: Guys, PowerShell is, again, another way to provide instruction. We'll talk about that later. Mac people will not face any issue, it is pretty straightforward.


807
01:34:52.837 --> 01:34:59.866
Monal S: You can either… if this doesn't work, go here. If this also doesn't work, go here. Only 3 instructions is there.


808
01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:15.866
Monal S: For people, it is showing like this, that it is success, it means UV installed.


809
01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:22.387
Monal S: Make sure that you are in PowerShell. Close everything, close the terminal, and I will show you one again.


810
01:35:29.987 --> 01:35:34.697
Monal S: People are able to do it in PowerShell. Guys, if it is showing error.


811
01:35:35.007 --> 01:35:39.207
Monal S: If it is showing error in Mac, run with this one, wget.


812
01:35:45.797 --> 01:35:49.686
Monal S: And also try to run this if you… it is not working.


813
01:35:50.017 --> 01:35:53.377
Monal S: Guys, tell me why UV is required. Everyone?


814
01:35:54.107 --> 01:35:56.326
Monal S: Why UV is required, tell me.


815
01:36:06.947 --> 01:36:10.986
Monal S: People who are working in company laptop or something, they might get an error.


816
01:36:15.387 --> 01:36:18.557
Monal S: Everyone, why we are working with UV?


817
01:36:19.047 --> 01:36:30.687
Monal S: So that we can work with multiple versions of Python, and we don't want… we want a software which is very user-friendly. UV is very user-friendly.


818
01:36:33.507 --> 01:36:34.537
Monal S: Alright?


819
01:36:34.867 --> 01:36:50.896
Monal S: So guys, go to UV documentation, you are going to be developer, read the things here. Because we don't have time today, we will see all the errors later, but if you're not able to do it for now, it's totally fine. This class was more about understanding tools.


820
01:36:51.557 --> 01:37:00.996
Monal S: Guys, we'll talk about how to create Python version, we don't have time. Once UV is done, guys, if it is not working, skip it for now. Skip it for now, we'll check it later as well.


821
01:37:01.167 --> 01:37:02.227
Monal S: Alright?


822
01:37:06.797 --> 01:37:07.827
Monal S: Alright?


823
01:37:08.177 --> 01:37:16.636
Monal S: And now let's talk about VS Code. Guys, in the meantime, VS Code is also downloaded for all of you, yes?


824
01:37:17.027 --> 01:37:20.076
Monal S: Guys, no specific version of UV, just go to the latest version.


825
01:37:20.457 --> 01:37:26.867
Monal S: And this is download. Click on this file, click on this file, and here you will see this.


826
01:37:28.417 --> 01:37:34.267
Monal S: Install the VS Code, double-click on the VS Code. I accept the agreement, see this?


827
01:37:34.637 --> 01:37:36.147
Monal S: This is VSCore.


828
01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:49.797
Monal S: First you have to do is, guys, you can rewatch the recording, it's totally fine, okay? It is only 2 hours class. Or maybe I can keep a doubt session where I will solve all of your queries later, alright? But, you can see this setup, I accept the agreement.


829
01:37:50.017 --> 01:37:53.166
Monal S: This is the first thing which you will do. Click on Next.


830
01:37:53.277 --> 01:38:01.227
Monal S: Click on next, this is where you are installing your VS Code, alright? And click on Next, and it will install, it will start.


831
01:38:01.397 --> 01:38:04.087
Monal S: It will start the installation.


832
01:38:08.627 --> 01:38:12.426
Monal S: Guys, for VS Code, what is the version I told you?


833
01:38:13.027 --> 01:38:17.097
Monal S: For VS Code, I told you to do System Installer.


834
01:38:17.757 --> 01:38:18.827
Monal S: Everyone?


835
01:38:18.977 --> 01:38:20.617
Monal S: System Installer.


836
01:38:23.387 --> 01:38:29.926
Monal S: If it is giving you the CLI version, go to the zip one and then install it, or click on just download.


837
01:38:33.387 --> 01:38:40.047
Monal S: Marvin, I explained on a high level that it will help us manage multiple projects and install a few things later.


838
01:38:41.427 --> 01:38:43.667
Monal S: Are we clear, Mobin? UV.


839
01:38:45.457 --> 01:38:48.367
Monal S: Guys, you can also click on directly here, it will work.


840
01:38:50.727 --> 01:38:57.096
Monal S: Guys, if it is not supporting… if it is showing you not supported in your system while in Windows.


841
01:38:57.227 --> 01:38:58.177
Monal S: Check.


842
01:38:58.707 --> 01:39:04.386
Monal S: downloading using this ARM64, and guys, make sure that you have latest version of Windows.


843
01:39:04.527 --> 01:39:06.806
Monal S: Windows 11, at least you should be working.


844
01:39:07.827 --> 01:39:11.776
Monal S: Firos is able to install UV and VS Code, that's great, Firos.


845
01:39:23.777 --> 01:39:25.666
Monal S: Rahul, it is working.


846
01:39:26.227 --> 01:39:27.347
Monal S: That's great.


847
01:39:28.827 --> 01:39:32.757
Monal S: Guys, you don't… if you already have VS4 in your system, you don't have to do it.


848
01:39:33.107 --> 01:39:34.467
Monal S: Done, done.


849
01:39:34.857 --> 01:39:48.607
Monal S: Installed UV and VS Code, that's great. So guys, only two files are there, either install using this, install using this, install using this. And I will tell you one more method. Everyone, I will tell you one more method.


850
01:39:48.867 --> 01:40:00.916
Monal S: Because the class, I might… if I see a lot of errors, other people might help in the community, or I will arrange a different class for people who is not able to install it, okay?


851
01:40:01.027 --> 01:40:04.397
Monal S: But not in the main class. We will do it later. Just wait.


852
01:40:11.217 --> 01:40:16.147
Monal S: Lot of people are able to install it, that's great. This is perfect. Yes, guys, this is perfect.


853
01:40:16.277 --> 01:40:27.766
Monal S: Okay, for people whose UV is installed, open your terminal, close everything, close VS Code, open your terminal, and try to write UV, and press enter.


854
01:40:28.177 --> 01:40:32.496
Monal S: Just write UV in your terminal and press enter.


855
01:40:35.117 --> 01:40:40.147
Monal S: And press enter. If it is showing you a lot of things, it means you've been successful.


856
01:40:43.597 --> 01:40:48.277
Monal S: Guys, if it is not running, don't worry, we will provide support. Don't worry.


857
01:40:49.337 --> 01:40:53.256
Monal S: If UV command is working in your system, it means your task is done.


858
01:40:54.197 --> 01:40:56.866
Monal S: The tools required to learn Python is done.


859
01:40:58.947 --> 01:41:03.546
Monal S: For people who are getting error, guys, now we are in vibe coding error.


860
01:41:03.917 --> 01:41:14.577
Monal S: Yes, UV needs restart after installation. Some people might need to restart the system, some people might need to re… just close the terminal and open again. That is restart. If it is working, then it is fine.


861
01:41:16.407 --> 01:41:17.317
Monal S: Okay?


862
01:41:17.567 --> 01:41:19.526
Monal S: If it is working, then it is fine.


863
01:41:21.447 --> 01:41:35.007
Monal S: Worked flawlessly, that's great. How many people are also able to install VS Code? Guys, I'm not installing again, you just click on next. It will install, installation will be done. Very simple. Just like you install application in a mobile, VS Code is simple as that.


864
01:41:36.117 --> 01:41:38.547
Monal S: Install both, Create.


865
01:41:38.697 --> 01:41:41.127
Monal S: For people who are not able to do, don't worry!


866
01:41:41.247 --> 01:41:47.717
Monal S: Don't worry. This class was more about understanding tools. Now I'm giving you one very important tool.


867
01:41:49.797 --> 01:41:50.857
Monal S: See this?


868
01:41:52.547 --> 01:41:59.586
Monal S: Let me show you… One very important tool in 2026.


869
01:42:02.307 --> 01:42:06.636
Monal S: For everyone, others, How many of you know this tool?


870
01:42:07.617 --> 01:42:09.447
Monal S: How many of you know this tool?


871
01:42:10.667 --> 01:42:14.236
Monal S: After the class is done, whoever is getting error.


872
01:42:14.367 --> 01:42:20.167
Monal S: First, tell that you are trying to install UV, and paste your error here.


873
01:42:20.707 --> 01:42:33.177
Monal S: It will give you instruction, follow the instruction, try to solve it. If not, we will do it in next class, in doubt session, or I will show you some other method where you don't require installation.


874
01:42:33.527 --> 01:42:39.907
Monal S: Try to solve it, it will give you instruction, try to read it, that's how you become a great developer.


875
01:42:41.627 --> 01:42:49.857
Monal S: Yes, this is the first step to become a developer, guys. What is the one very important step to become a developer? Can anyone guess?


876
01:42:50.547 --> 01:42:54.026
Monal S: Can anyone guess what is the most important


877
01:42:55.787 --> 01:43:01.186
Monal S: Most important factor to become a developer, it is to debug.


878
01:43:01.997 --> 01:43:06.967
Monal S: Guys, trust me, I learned debug from playing games.


879
01:43:07.767 --> 01:43:08.996
Monal S: Playing games.


880
01:43:09.447 --> 01:43:23.697
Monal S: When, I was, like, 15, 14 or 15, okay? I was installing games in my computer, it was giving me error, I was going to the internet, checking the error, going to internet, until it is fixed.


881
01:43:23.877 --> 01:43:31.866
Monal S: I'm not doing any coding. I was just going to the internet to read about it, what is that error, why I'm getting it, and then moving it again.


882
01:43:32.237 --> 01:43:43.777
Monal S: If you're not able to debug your system, I will help you, but today I'm telling. If you're not able to understand why you're getting error, what are the other things, how you're going to solve other things in your company.


883
01:43:45.697 --> 01:43:50.767
Monal S: We are learning 2026 way. You also have to become a great developer.


884
01:43:52.467 --> 01:43:54.646
Monal S: Is everyone clear? Yes, Sonak?


885
01:43:54.847 --> 01:43:56.006
Monal S: I still do it.


886
01:43:56.417 --> 01:44:12.687
Monal S: Is everyone clear? Whoever is getting error, just try from your side. I will be active in the community, alright? If required, I will also arrange one session for people who is getting error. But if you don't try, it is going to make me disappointed in you.


887
01:44:12.957 --> 01:44:23.847
Monal S: Without debug, how can you become a great programmer? I am telling each and everything from the very base, and I will again help you from the very base. But if you don't try from today, that is day one.


888
01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:27.727
Monal S: I cannot help you in the future. That is, once the class is over.


889
01:44:29.627 --> 01:44:32.316
Monal S: Is everyone clear how you're going to debug it?


890
01:44:32.627 --> 01:44:45.597
Monal S: tell the Gemini, because Gemini has access, what you will do? I am… Trying to install UV in Windows.


891
01:44:46.667 --> 01:44:53.157
Monal S: I am getting… I am getting… Below error.


892
01:44:53.317 --> 01:44:59.017
Monal S: Paste the error from the terminal which you're getting, and then try to debug it.


893
01:45:02.637 --> 01:45:09.067
Monal S: Rajat, you still need… we still need to learn a lot. For people who are asking, guys, one very…


894
01:45:09.167 --> 01:45:14.607
Monal S: Important thing which I need to tell you. Lot of people are saying, sir, why not Jupiter?


895
01:45:14.797 --> 01:45:23.096
Monal S: Why not Jupyter? Guys, Jupyter is a different tool we'll talk about later. That's why we are installing the first thing. Jupyter, we don't require installation.


896
01:45:24.327 --> 01:45:28.637
Monal S: For people who are seeing Jupyter, Jupiter, see this, what I'm able to do here.


897
01:45:30.957 --> 01:45:32.916
Monal S: See now what I'm able to do here.


898
01:45:37.977 --> 01:45:43.146
Monal S: For people who are saying Jupyter, are we able to have Jupyter also in VS Code?


899
01:45:45.607 --> 01:45:49.496
Monal S: Are we able to have Jupyter cells, notebook cells in VS Code?


900
01:45:53.607 --> 01:45:59.016
Monal S: Then… Why do you want to install 5,000 things just to learn Python?


901
01:45:59.237 --> 01:46:02.077
Monal S: How many of you want to complicate this journey?


902
01:46:02.577 --> 01:46:05.577
Monal S: It's totally fine. Guys, I'm not targeting anyone.


903
01:46:05.967 --> 01:46:12.777
Monal S: I want you to understand that they… that this way, whatever we are doing, will help you understand things very fast.


904
01:46:13.277 --> 01:46:14.727
Monal S: Simple is efficient.


905
01:46:14.827 --> 01:46:17.257
Monal S: Alright? So, by today.


906
01:46:17.567 --> 01:46:29.377
Monal S: what we… by the end of this class, we are already in the end of this class. For people who are getting this error, I want you to learn more by yourself, then we'll talk about how to fix it, because it is already around


907
01:46:29.527 --> 01:46:41.706
Monal S: 2 hours, 15 minutes is left. So guys, are we able to complete… are we able to learn a lot in this class? At least the flow for people who have assignments, that is to debug with the help of AI,


908
01:46:41.887 --> 01:46:46.166
Monal S: Understand the whole process of why we even have the VS Code.


909
01:46:46.587 --> 01:46:48.886
Monal S: If you don't, please revise the class.


910
01:46:49.067 --> 01:46:58.997
Monal S: We understood the computers in depth, from the flow of it, we understood tools, why we are even having the tools, and the special announcement now that we have it.


911
01:46:59.547 --> 01:47:11.667
Monal S: So guys, let me stop sharing, alright? Yes, guys, live session is always more interactive, and guys, I am raising one thing, which we are going to do always. Just wait a second, okay?


912
01:47:11.797 --> 01:47:13.277
Monal S: Just wait a second.


913
01:47:19.727 --> 01:47:36.467
Monal S: Guys, I'm raising a poll. I want each and every one to write their remarks. Non-tech and tech people, this helps me understand. I'm not able to see your names, but I will be able to understand from Krista's feedback that what I have to do in this class.


914
01:47:36.467 --> 01:47:43.666
Monal S: But guys, trust me, no one will teach you this slow. How many of you can agree this? No one will teach you in this level.


915
01:47:44.417 --> 01:47:47.566
Monal S: Check anywhere in the YouTube. No one will teach you.


916
01:47:48.767 --> 01:48:08.516
Monal S: So, stay with me in this journey, help me improve, help me understand what you guys require. This is a first class, this is a journey, I will understand from your pace, you also have to do homework, whatever assignment which I'm going to give. Guys, I've launched the poll. In the meantime, I will call, my answer, and my answer will join the class.


917
01:48:08.657 --> 01:48:09.497
Monal S: All right?


918
01:48:15.857 --> 01:48:17.986
Monal S: Thank you very much, Ray. Thank you.


919
01:48:18.207 --> 01:48:23.246
Monal S: So, I'm going to stop my video, and I will be back, guys, okay?


920
01:48:23.517 --> 01:48:25.156
Monal S: Please write the remarks.


921
01:49:16.567 --> 01:49:21.186
Monal S: Sorry about that. Yeah. Guys, everyone knows what to do on the LinkedIn.


922
01:49:21.687 --> 01:49:34.496
Monal S: Don't paste everything in the LinkedIn. What you want to tell is that this is what the knowledge is, this is what I was able to learn, tag me, tag Krisha, tag Krishna, whoever you want.


923
01:49:34.657 --> 01:49:37.466
Monal S: And, this is how you build confidence.


924
01:49:37.687 --> 01:49:39.307
Monal S: Yes, thank you very much, guys.


925
01:49:53.917 --> 01:49:56.737
Monal S: Just give me a second, okay…


926
01:49:57.037 --> 01:50:01.837
Monal S: Just going to invite Krisha… not Krisha, my answer, alright? So just wait.


927
01:50:12.647 --> 01:50:14.107
Monal S: Give me a second, guys.


928
01:50:16.527 --> 01:50:29.137
Monal S: Please stay, because this is very important. You will see one… whoever is going to stay is only going to, get profit from this. So I will suggest everyone to please stay, then only you will get


929
01:50:30.737 --> 01:50:32.907
Monal S: Surprise. Good surprise.


930
01:50:42.997 --> 01:50:43.677
Monal S: All right.


931
01:50:45.747 --> 01:50:54.297
Monal S: And guys, we don't have time for the question, but don't worry, we are not skipping the question. As I mentioned, this is what we are going to expect in Wednesday class.


932
01:50:58.947 --> 01:50:59.777
Monal S: Alright?


933
01:51:00.007 --> 01:51:06.107

Mayank: Nice.


935
01:51:07.437 --> 01:51:08.207
Monal S: Alright.


936
01:51:08.207 --> 01:51:08.997
Mayank: co-host.


937
01:51:08.997 --> 01:51:12.066
Monal S: Guys, yes, Mangster is here.


938
01:51:12.717 --> 01:51:16.097
Mayank: Cool. Hi, everyone. So, I hope all of you are doing great.


939
01:51:16.927 --> 01:51:22.327
Mayank: And yes, I know that you might have a very great session, so if you can just stay back, please, will be helpful.


940
01:51:22.497 --> 01:51:32.446
Mayank: Cool. So yeah, pretty sure many of you might know me, extremely sorry. I am a little less active on your, like, the life cycles and everything, because of something which we are doing it.


941
01:51:32.787 --> 01:51:39.117
Mayank: Yes, actually, we have the name with Sir's account, right? So that's why it's always a different name. Let me make it right.


942
01:51:39.857 --> 01:51:45.396
Mayank: Great, great, great. So yeah, nice everyone. We already want to, of course, give you something, and…


943
01:51:45.537 --> 01:51:51.377
Mayank: As promised, although not, like, part of the course, but we want to make sure that our student gets the best of the things.


944
01:51:51.807 --> 01:52:04.027
Mayank: So, how many of, like, many of you must have, like, will it be from non-tech or even starting from tech background? But yes, there are a few things which you still need to catch on, and that is specifically regarding to AI.


945
01:52:04.237 --> 01:52:14.446
Mayank: And for the same, I recently actually started working on a very, very important course, which is generally something which no one will teach you, okay? It's not a concept or something.


946
01:52:14.667 --> 01:52:22.247
Mayank: So, many of you might be aware that I create content on automation, etc. as well, like, even though I have a full-blown, in-depth tech knowledge as well.


947
01:52:22.497 --> 01:52:27.886
Mayank: And yeah, last time I showed you the Evolve view, right, everyone? Which we gave you the access, so please make sure that you try out that.


948
01:52:28.567 --> 01:52:41.876
Mayank: Parallelily, I actually am running an AI agency as well, like, which is giving a good revenue and everything. And learning on top of that, everyone, we actually came up with, lots of learnings from that, right? That how exactly can we


949
01:52:42.197 --> 01:52:53.276
Mayank: open our own agency. And for the same, we have created a course, okay? So, the course has been taken by me, where it is generally practical. Now, I will be really honest.


950
01:52:53.587 --> 01:53:04.467
Mayank: I am not telling or selling any quick routine or something, you will see the course is very, very practical. So let me first show you the course, everyone, so that you get an idea of the same, okay?


951
01:53:04.997 --> 01:53:13.806
Mayank: So, you'll just see on your screen, just me open it. So, many things will be opened. Please, avoid the same. Many, many things are happening.


952
01:53:14.337 --> 01:53:16.247
Mayank: Right? So, pay attention.


953
01:53:16.637 --> 01:53:17.347
Mayank: See?


954
01:53:17.647 --> 01:53:26.436
Mayank: and attend Production Mastery from 0 to Agency Ready in 30 days. Now, this, as I was saying, the things which we have taught in this course, right, everyone?


955
01:53:26.827 --> 01:53:36.617
Mayank: Believe me, no one will teach you, because these are all coming from my experience. It is not that you can find these things anywhere, and once I scroll down, you will get to know about the same.


956
01:53:36.647 --> 01:53:48.117
Mayank: So, in that, everyone, if you will see, and on that, I will also share more learning opportunities with you. Because, see, all of you are now starting your journey, many of you are experienced and unexperienced, or in college.


957
01:53:48.117 --> 01:53:59.167
Mayank: But as things are, like, going on AI space, of course, you will have to make sure that you are on top of that. So, meanwhile, you, like, all just make your skills a lot better.


958
01:53:59.297 --> 01:54:10.427
Mayank: Meanwhile, we are spending the time to sharpen our skills with this course. We want that you are on top of other things as well, that is, how to actually understand AI, how to actually now provide that services.


959
01:54:10.427 --> 01:54:19.936
Mayank: So, even in college, you can actually start earning. Now, just to give you an example, right, I have, and I will take 5-7 minutes, because it's not that we give you the course and be happy, no.


960
01:54:20.417 --> 01:54:26.997
Mayank: I have, like, 3 people working with me, and in the last 6 months, all of them have earned in lakhs with me.


961
01:54:27.247 --> 01:54:40.876
Mayank: So we… I… what I do is, I guide them on how to actually help clients, they understand everything about AI. I've given them my course as well, right? So we will be trying to do that, and they are… like, they are in college only, so second and third year, right?


962
01:54:41.197 --> 01:54:46.607
Mayank: Now, if people are aware, I also have a video on YouTube. Like, it's actually going pretty good.


963
01:54:46.717 --> 01:54:53.417
Mayank: And if you will go and see, like, all they did was they saw this video, reached out to me, showed their skins it is 401K views.


964
01:54:53.667 --> 01:55:00.286
Mayank: Learned about all the concepts from me. I will be putting up another video in, like, some days. It is actually just have to edit it out.


965
01:55:00.477 --> 01:55:02.376
Mayank: And they were actually able to earn in lakhs.


966
01:55:02.677 --> 01:55:07.656
Mayank: And they're still in college, second, third year, and they are also learning these things which you all are learning, right? So…


967
01:55:07.787 --> 01:55:13.646
Mayank: Understanding these things, everyone, we created this course where I've talked all about the agency and everything, right?


968
01:55:13.807 --> 01:55:17.817
Mayank: And I have made sure that this is very, very practical.


969
01:55:17.937 --> 01:55:25.617
Mayank: So, parallel also, everyone, I've shared my school community link, so please make sure that you go through the same, you join the same, because in there.


970
01:55:26.127 --> 01:55:29.946
Mayank: Like, there are lots of, again, learnings there, right?


971
01:55:30.097 --> 01:55:35.857
Mayank: Now, with respect to that, everyone, if you will now follow, please pause the video.


972
01:55:35.967 --> 01:55:38.757
Mayank: Which video you're talking, Prince?


973
01:55:39.607 --> 01:55:42.247
Mayank: I don't think the size audio is shared, but anyways.


974
01:55:42.427 --> 01:55:55.797
Mayank: Great. So, yes, in there, you will see that how this is a very, very basic thing, with all the NHN-related part is also covered. It is totally from beginners, right? I have shared all the learnings which you need. I have shared projects as well.


975
01:55:55.957 --> 01:56:04.746
Mayank: intermediate, like, it is generally 5 plus projects, and I will be adding more. So the idea is pretty simple in here, that you will have to just learn and go through this course.


976
01:56:04.867 --> 01:56:14.217
Mayank: And then you have to make sure that you apply the same. So I have covered the client workflow organization, how to find clients, how to price your automation projects as well.


977
01:56:14.387 --> 01:56:16.717
Mayank: No prerequisites, it's totally from beginner.


978
01:56:16.867 --> 01:56:20.566
Mayank: Client onboarding and delivery, how to actually talk, because again.


979
01:56:20.997 --> 01:56:32.716
Mayank: Many people are just selling wasted dream in here that, hey, sell this for lakhs or something, but no one teach how to actually do that. Via this course, our aim is to make sure that it is very much in-depth.


980
01:56:32.817 --> 01:56:45.786
Mayank: So, these are all the projects and everything which you can see. The good thing is that it also has a role play, everyone. So, where you will be able to talk to a client in real life, okay? So, I hope the same is clear. Anyone has any doubt with respect to this course?


981
01:56:46.087 --> 01:56:49.286
Mayank: So, on a case, what does NAT and mean and everything, you will get an idea, okay?


982
01:56:50.747 --> 01:57:03.007
Mayank: Arias, I will, I will update the thing. Not visible in Udemy business, yes, because we have just launched it, it takes some time, okay? So, yeah, everyone, we will be giving you the free access. Now, before we do that, just a humble request.


983
01:57:03.337 --> 01:57:10.876
Mayank: Now, the second you get an access to this course, or rather any of our course, okay, now we sell it for a very minimal price of $399,


984
01:57:11.397 --> 01:57:18.247
Mayank: please make sure that you go to the course, like, just, I will show you, let's say I go to this course, which is, again, of mine only.


985
01:57:18.677 --> 01:57:24.026
Mayank: And you give quotes a 5-star rating, okay? So I will show where you get the 5-star rating as well, just a minute.


986
01:57:24.507 --> 01:57:27.347
Mayank: Right, so do make sure that you go to the course, everyone.


987
01:57:27.577 --> 01:57:32.317
Mayank: And in that course, which you are attending, since you are getting it for free via us.


988
01:57:32.567 --> 01:57:34.547
Mayank: And of course, it is not easy.


989
01:57:35.217 --> 01:57:39.597
Mayank: Just make sure that when you take the course, you get a rating button here, right?


990
01:57:39.797 --> 01:57:43.117
Mayank: So, please, please, just a humble request, give it a 5-star rating.


991
01:57:43.347 --> 01:57:47.496
Mayank: The material will, of course, be 5-star, you don't have to worry on that, for sure.


992
01:57:47.857 --> 01:57:53.977
Mayank: And this specific course which I'm telling you, It is genuinely


993
01:57:54.117 --> 01:58:08.647
Mayank: very, very helpful. Like, it can make you earn in lakhs for sure, and I am not… like, if you will see the course, you will see that, why I'm saying that, okay? So, yes, once you get the course, once you go on My Learning, and let's say, access the course.


994
01:58:08.647 --> 01:58:17.837
Mayank: then please make sure that you rate the course, leave a very good rating, everything, okay? So, that's the whole case. Can you explain anything in layman terms?


995
01:58:18.197 --> 01:58:21.067
Mayank: What you have to do… One minute…


996
01:58:21.187 --> 01:58:25.197
Mayank: what you have to do, Baichu, is just go to my YouTube channel, okay?


997
01:58:25.327 --> 01:58:29.656
Mayank: Do subscribe to that, because again, more content on N10 is coming, but just see this video, okay?


998
01:58:30.667 --> 01:58:38.206
Mayank: I'm actually an NHN certified, as well now, so they reached out and actually I attend their link, so just, just see this video.


999
01:58:38.407 --> 01:58:41.976
Mayank: It is an 8-hour masterclass, you will not be needing anything else.


1000
01:58:42.277 --> 01:58:43.107
Mayank: Okay.


1001
01:58:43.207 --> 01:58:45.246
Mayank: Anyone has any other doubt before I move forward?


1002
01:58:53.057 --> 01:58:55.177
Mayank: When you say people are learning in lax.


1003
01:58:55.627 --> 01:59:03.767
Mayank: Are they doing freelancing by this? Yes, yes, sort of. So, again, I… they're helping me in my agency, where we take up client use cases, and we try to automate that.


1004
01:59:04.137 --> 01:59:06.407
Mayank: And yes, Python or nothing is required.


1005
01:59:06.607 --> 01:59:08.177
Mayank: If you just see this video.


1006
01:59:08.897 --> 01:59:16.756
Mayank: And if you just then start watching, it will be more than enough. Because, again, it is no code. For people who are not aware, N10 is something like this.


1007
01:59:16.897 --> 01:59:18.546
Mayank: It is totally no good thing.


1008
01:59:18.957 --> 01:59:23.257
Mayank: So just drag and drop in things, like, no code is required. That is what is no code means, right?


1009
01:59:23.617 --> 01:59:25.186
Mayank: I hope the same is clear, everyone.


1010
01:59:27.767 --> 01:59:29.107
Mayank: Anyone has any doubt?


1011
01:59:29.237 --> 01:59:35.307
Mayank: How to log in and everything? Okay, I will be providing the link. Can you tell me what you have to do after you get the link?


1012
01:59:36.227 --> 01:59:37.506
Mayank: Two things you have to do.


1013
01:59:37.667 --> 01:59:38.467
Mayank: First.


1014
01:59:38.667 --> 01:59:48.096
Mayank: access and learn from the course. Second, please make sure that you leave a review. So, when you go to this link, everyone, this is how you will see that the course will start, and it's a lifetime access.


1015
01:59:48.207 --> 01:59:59.036
Mayank: it is a lifetime access as well, okay, everyone? So please, please leave a review, because that helps us to get it to more students for a very reasonable price. And that is our aim via Udemy, that


1016
01:59:59.637 --> 02:00:06.076
Mayank: Teaching should not be difficult, right? And believe me, the quality will be top-notch, that I can really assure you, okay?


1017
02:00:06.857 --> 02:00:14.646
Mayank: Cool! So, yes, let me just go, and I will paste the link and give it in your chat. And yes, everyone, what you have to do…


1018
02:00:15.487 --> 02:00:18.036
Mayank: Give a 5-star rating.


1019
02:00:18.797 --> 02:00:23.016
Mayank: And make sure to actually learn from courses where, okay? From where?


1020
02:00:23.257 --> 02:00:27.987
Mayank: For people who are not aware about N10, please see my video, please join my school community.


1021
02:00:28.097 --> 02:00:33.897
Mayank: Believe me, it's a very, very important skill. No code is required, and meanwhile, you sharpen your skills here.


1022
02:00:34.037 --> 02:00:36.787
Mayank: Please make sure that you take the full benefit of that, okay?


1023
02:00:37.007 --> 02:00:43.436
Mayank: So, that is the whole learning everywhere. I'm sharing my LinkedIn and YouTube as well, meanwhile. So, just give me a minute, I'm creating the course coupon.


1024
02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:48.146
Mayank: So that I can provide that for you, for all of you for free, okay?

1029
02:01:15.117 --> 02:01:18.046
Mayank: you will be getting the same for free. And click Enroll now.


1030
02:01:19.547 --> 02:01:20.527
Mayank: Understood?


1031
02:01:22.287 --> 02:01:28.087
Mayank: Clear. Please take this, because again, this has a limit in terms of time, as well as in terms of your,


1032
02:01:28.197 --> 02:01:29.596
Mayank: Numbers as well.


1033
02:01:29.857 --> 02:01:35.187
Mayank: And yes, once you do purchase, please make sure that you give the 5-star rating, and meanwhile, see the video as well, okay?


1034
02:01:37.457 --> 02:01:40.907
Mayank: Shivangi, again, tools can change, not a problem.


1035
02:01:41.397 --> 02:01:43.407
Mayank: I have taught concepts here.


1036
02:01:43.587 --> 02:01:49.976
Mayank: We don't… we never teach you a tool. When Monasar will be teaching you Python, he will not be just teaching you Python, he will teach you the full programming.


1037
02:01:50.087 --> 02:01:56.507
Mayank: So that if tomorrow you start with Java, that will be easy. So everyone who are not able to access, my agency is the one.


1038
02:01:57.287 --> 02:01:58.127
Mayank: Okay?


1039
02:01:58.987 --> 02:02:03.197
Mayank: Please give the 5-star rating, as I said, and I assure all of you will love the quotes, okay?


1040
02:02:03.337 --> 02:02:05.056

1041
02:02:05.437 --> 02:02:07.687
Mayank: It is free right now, I can enroll.


1042
02:02:09.467 --> 02:02:10.667
Mayank: Understood, everyone?

Mayank: Many of you are able to take it. Please take it. Please leave happy, good comments. Please give it a 5-star rating. That, I think, will be very helpful for us, because that helps us to reach more and more people. Once the codes, and again, our aim is to make sure that once you have paid for this, you get more than what we promised you.


1044
02:02:28.147 --> 02:02:28.967
Mayank: Okay?

02:02:46.107 --> 02:02:51.067
Mayank: Understood? Do we get the above links in coding? No, you will not be getting it. You are just getting it right now.


1050
02:02:53.567 --> 02:02:55.406
Mayank: Okay, I'm pasting it again and again.


1051
02:02:56.837 --> 02:02:58.397
Mayank: Pasting it again and again.


1052
02:02:59.267 --> 02:03:02.827
Mayank: Please make sure that you go through the same, everyone. Will be very, very helpful.


1053
02:03:03.807 --> 02:03:10.947
Mayank: Please also make sure that you do it. Ronick, sir, what's the purpose of the group in school? Ronick, again, join it and you will get to know, not a problem, okay?


1054
02:03:11.767 --> 02:03:15.646
Mayank: Unable to copy the code? Okay. One minute.


1055
02:03:19.777 --> 02:03:22.556
Mayank: Once enrolled, how will we have the access? Lifetime.


1056
02:03:23.127 --> 02:03:30.126
Mayank: Lifetime access. And it will be getting updated. So as of now, I think it has around 21 hours of content. It will be getting updated.


1057
02:03:31.247 --> 02:03:34.996
Mayank: Intro video, yes, so I have to update the same, don't worry, this is where it starts.


1058
02:03:35.217 --> 02:03:38.307
Mayank: Don't worry, I will be updating, okay? Please give it a 5-star rating.

1101
02:07:40.287 --> 02:07:46.167
Mayank: And as I said, please take the advantage, it will not be free forever. It is just that when we launch a course, we get a coupon.


1102
02:07:46.327 --> 02:07:54.607
Mayank: Now, we could sell that coupon as well, but we make sure that we're providing this for free to our students. If we want, we can generally send it to any company and anyone as well, right?


1103
02:07:54.747 --> 02:07:59.567
Mayank: But we want to make sure that, yes, we are rather using it for our students instead.


1104
02:07:59.997 --> 02:08:05.407
Mayank: Okay, everyone, so I see that there are lots of people, and I want each and every one of you to take this, benefit.

1111
02:08:42.427 --> 02:08:51.176
Mayank: each and everything. In school, I will approve the membership. I have to go through your, this again myself, but don't worry. Please, meanwhile, join the school community, though, everyone.


1112
02:08:51.737 --> 02:09:06.646
Mayank: So, please, please join the school community as well, because there you will get some more things as well, okay? Yes, Priya, so once you complete the course, there will be a certificate. But believe me, this course is not, like, beyond certificate, it is very helpful.


1113
02:09:06.847 --> 02:09:15.396
Mayank: It teaches how to handle clients, how to talk to someone, how to create the proper use case, how to understand that, all those things which no one teaches you.


1114
02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:21.697
Mayank: Because, yes, this course is generally very special. Here, you will see how to handle clients, no one tell you about that, right?


1115
02:09:22.357 --> 02:09:24.246
Mayank: So, yeah, that's the case.


1116
02:09:28.147 --> 02:09:29.197
Mayank: Understood?


1117
02:09:31.487 --> 02:09:33.177
Mayank: Any doubt, anyone? Let me know.


1118
02:09:38.487 --> 02:09:41.696
Mayank: Do we need internet subscription or anything? No, nothing. It's totally free.


1119
02:09:42.857 --> 02:09:49.367
Mayank: If you do start to plan your agency, you might have to… you might have to purchase a VPS, but I have covered that as well, so don't worry.


1120
02:09:50.097 --> 02:09:50.917
Mayank: Cool?


1121
02:09:55.137 --> 02:09:58.816
Mayank: And yes, as I said, please take full advantage, it might get over.


1122
02:10:00.267 --> 02:10:07.957
Mayank: Ha! Great, everyone! So, I think that was all, and I will try that I can get you more and more free accesses, so that your journey of learning is very much


1123
02:10:08.077 --> 02:10:09.357
Mayank: accelerated.


1124
02:10:09.467 --> 02:10:12.806
Mayank: Meanwhile, do put in full effort in this class, okay?


1125
02:10:13.187 --> 02:10:18.746
Mayank: Mona said if any doubt, anything is related, because people are asking if they can drop off, but I think we'll be taking doubts, right?


1126
02:10:20.457 --> 02:10:22.236
Mayank: I'm gonna set up your mute behavior.


1127
02:10:23.637 --> 02:10:24.617
Monal S: That's right.


1128
02:10:24.727 --> 02:10:37.896
Monal S: Yes, actually, what I told everyone, that this Wednesday, class is going to be short and boost of our course. So drop session and other things will be major on the Friday and Sunday. This one is for boosting the course pace, and it will be done by Wednesdays.


1129
02:10:38.887 --> 02:10:39.966
Monal S: Well, let's class.


1130
02:10:40.697 --> 02:10:43.646
Mayank: Great, then I think even we can thank…


1131
02:10:43.927 --> 02:10:47.276
Mayank: Like, thanks all of you, and if you have any questions, I can quickly answer it.


1132
02:10:47.277 --> 02:11:03.406
Monal S: And guys, please do rate 5-star, this is an amazing course, you guys will be able to… and for people, of course, there are a lot of freshers, which I'm able to see, asking that what this course will be able to do. Guys, first, focus on learning. Only after you learn something, then you understand the main power that this…


1133
02:11:03.407 --> 02:11:09.187
Monal S: provides you, right? You will be able to do a lot of amazing things, you will be able to provide automation for yourself as well.


1134
02:11:09.537 --> 02:11:14.477
Monal S: If you learn all of that, then it will open a lot of opportunities for you.


1135
02:11:14.477 --> 02:11:25.726
Mayank: Or rather, just also go to my channel and see this, and as Munasar said, lots of things you will be able to do via this course. It's not a just, let's say, course where you learn and then you wait for a job. No, it is where you can start your own


1136
02:11:25.887 --> 02:11:27.927
Mayank: Agency and start earning money right away.


1137
02:11:28.197 --> 02:11:34.586
Mayank: And once you master skills with Monon Search in future, everything will kind of join dots, and you will see that how your learnings are accelerated.


1138
02:11:36.047 --> 02:11:38.896
Mayank: Sorry, Monica, you were saying… I just thought of sharing that.


1139
02:11:38.897 --> 02:11:52.597
Monal S: Yeah, yes, yes. So, don't look for opportunity first. First, you are here to learn something. Once you learn something, then the opportunities will be open for you. Don't look for opportunities first. Look for the skill, and then a skill will give you opportunity, guys.


1140
02:11:53.977 --> 02:12:08.906
Mayank: And as we said, everyone, please give it a full star, rating, 5 star, so that it is reaching out to more and more audience, will be very helpful for us. Because as I said, we want to make sure that we give you more than promise. In future, I will just make sure that I give you more and more courses for free.


1141
02:12:08.907 --> 02:12:17.307
Mayank: So I will… I have actually mailed you Demi specifically for this, because, of course, we also have a limit. But yeah, we want that we are able to provide you these things in a very, very…


1142
02:12:17.497 --> 02:12:23.557
Mayank: Like, free and proper manner, so you don't have to go anywhere else. That's our volume, and yes, everything is from scratch.


1143
02:12:23.687 --> 02:12:29.177
Mayank: You don't need to know anything for this course, and you, all these things, everyone, it is a lifetime access.


1144
02:12:29.347 --> 02:12:40.877
Mayank: So yes, please make sure that the least you can do, please, please leave a rating, so that it reaches out to more and more people. So anytime you start a video, it might not be available in the introduction, just give a rating here, okay?


1145
02:12:41.287 --> 02:12:44.097
Mayank: So you see this lever rating here? Give a 5-star, and it will be helpful.


1146
02:12:48.057 --> 02:12:54.647
Mayank: Naveen and everyone, please see the YouTube video. Please see this first only, I have covered everything in here as well. So, start with the course.


1147
02:12:55.027 --> 02:12:58.677
Mayank: Once you start with the course, all the basics of entertainment and everything is covered.


1148
02:12:58.917 --> 02:12:59.667
Mayank: Okay.


1149
02:12:59.797 --> 02:13:07.207
Mayank: School, I will be accepting the request, everyone. It's just that I'm here right now, right? So I cannot see all the requests, but I will do that in some time. Don't worry.


1150
02:13:08.977 --> 02:13:17.907
Mayank: So, see, all of this are there. There's a proper practical as well, where you can create a simple personal assistant without writing any line of code. Social media automation without writing any line of code.


1151
02:13:18.107 --> 02:13:22.146
Mayank: GitHub automation without interactive code. All the advanced concepts as well.


1152
02:13:22.557 --> 02:13:36.536
Mayank: NATN local, all these things I've taught, which… and NHN, for people who are not aware, just start with the course. You will get to learn about that, okay? I would rather explain about the right tools as well, so everything is covered. That's the whole aim, that everything is covered, you don't have to worry about anything, okay?


1153
02:13:37.017 --> 02:13:42.266
Mayank: So, as… and as Mulasar said, please, please first see the thing and you will get an idea, okay?


1154
02:13:44.967 --> 02:13:53.467
Mayank: Anyone want to connect with me? Actually, this is my email ID. Completely copy this, that will be helpful. Rowan, just join the school community, you will get to know. You will get an email, you will get to know on that.


1155
02:13:55.527 --> 02:14:01.046
Mayank: YouTube content in this, Udemy course content is same, no Lakshmi Kant. All our Udemy courses have a different content.


1156
02:14:01.717 --> 02:14:09.476
Mayank: Okay? They are very well properly divided, everything is there. So, again, we put a lot of effort in our content, no copy-pasting or that of content.


1157
02:14:10.767 --> 02:14:13.886
Mayank: Even if some part is overlapping, then also other things are there, okay?


1158
02:14:16.987 --> 02:14:17.897
Mayank: Cool.


1159
02:14:18.227 --> 02:14:25.277
Mayank: Yeah, I think that was all, everyone. I really hope everyone has taken the advantage, because as I said, don't wait. The course might… the coupon might get expired.


1160
02:14:25.597 --> 02:14:34.267
Mayank: And then you will not be able to get it, okay? So, that's the whole thing. Yeah. I think Mul said that was all. I don't see any major question or something.


1161
02:14:34.687 --> 02:14:35.896
Monal S: Yes, yes.


1162
02:14:35.897 --> 02:14:41.887
Mayank: Have we started any notional link or something, because people are not able to create check links, anything which we have done?


1163
02:14:43.207 --> 02:14:49.527
Monal S: No, no links… no, they are not able to click links on the chat, so I think chat, we need to enable the links click.


1164
02:14:49.767 --> 02:14:52.577
Monal S: They're not able to copy, I think, by default, it won't default.


1165
02:14:52.747 --> 02:14:53.567
Monal S: Stops it.


1166
02:14:53.717 --> 02:14:57.207
Mayank: Okay, one minute, everyone, I will just do one thing, just a second.


1167
02:14:58.517 --> 02:15:02.207
Mayank: Just for people who are not able to copy, I will just do one quick thing.


1168
02:15:05.277 --> 02:15:12.806
Mayank: Okay, so just quickly do one thing, everyone, okay? What I'm doing is, please make sure that you take full advantage of this.


1169
02:15:13.507 --> 02:15:14.237
Mayank: Si.


1170
02:15:14.627 --> 02:15:16.066
Mayank: Just go to your browser.


1171
02:15:16.647 --> 02:15:17.796
Mayank: And type this.


1172
02:15:18.347 --> 02:15:20.216
Mayank: So just go to your browser and type this.


1173
02:15:20.557 --> 02:15:23.067
Mayank: I think this is still a very simple thing to type.


1174
02:15:23.307 --> 02:15:25.936
Monal S: Yes, take a snap of it, and you will be able to see as well.


1175
02:15:25.937 --> 02:15:26.666
Mayank: is…


1176
02:15:30.067 --> 02:15:35.236
Mayank: Just type this, shorturl.addzx0.


1177
02:15:36.037 --> 02:15:42.656
Mayank: DZX0O. So, very easily typeable, nothing at a problem. And then you will be kind of taken to that link, okay?


1178
02:15:43.127 --> 02:15:46.307
Mayank: So, pretty simple thing, right? See, once I open this link?


1179
02:15:46.947 --> 02:15:48.096
Mayank: It will take me here.


1180
02:15:48.826 --> 02:15:51.407
Mayank: So I think now your problem is done, everyone?


1181
02:15:53.367 --> 02:15:54.197
Mayank: Okay?


1182
02:15:55.987 --> 02:15:56.627
Mayank: Understood.


1183
02:15:56.627 --> 02:16:05.787
Monal S: These notes are already provided in the community. I will also send in the chat here, but you can see in the community, I've already sent the zip file of today's class resource.


1184
02:16:09.967 --> 02:16:10.867
Mayank: Yes.


1185
02:16:11.117 --> 02:16:17.176
Mayank: Muhammad, the link will open for short now, so I think it will open. Like, I'm just genuinely now pasting the link, I think…


1186
02:16:18.307 --> 02:16:27.276
Mayank: After this, though, I will have to come at your end and open the same on your laptop, okay? So please make sure that you do that, should be fine, okay?


1187
02:16:27.517 --> 02:16:30.307
Mayank: See, as Monolsa said, make sure that you…


1188
02:16:30.517 --> 02:16:35.487
Mayank: Spend the effort now. Don't be like, oh, link is not opening, everything. I've given everything. I have OCR,


1189
02:16:35.627 --> 02:16:38.867
Mayank: Just write that shorter link which I've given you, right? This is the shorter link.


1190
02:16:39.107 --> 02:16:39.867
Mayank: See?


1191
02:16:41.377 --> 02:16:42.217
Mayank: Okay.


1192
02:16:42.326 --> 02:16:51.256
Mayank: So please take the advantage. I'm doing one more thing for all of you, okay? So one more thing. Still, I'm doing one thing. I'm pasting the same on your messages as well, where you see the Q&As and everything, okay?


1193
02:16:51.826 --> 02:16:55.947
Mayank: I think now it should be more than enough, everyone, but do make sure…


1194
02:16:57.457 --> 02:17:01.347
Mayank: to give course a 5-star rating, everyone.


1195
02:17:01.817 --> 02:17:04.377
Mayank: And leave a good time.


1196
02:17:05.166 --> 02:17:06.166
Mayank: Comment.


1197
02:17:06.887 --> 02:17:11.996
Mayank: and most… Most importantly, do.


1198
02:17:12.387 --> 02:17:16.296
Mayank: learn from the course. So, these things are very, very important, okay?


1199
02:17:19.707 --> 02:17:26.326
Mayank: If this course is for free, what will you do with 30 days money-back guarantee? And it is… it is for free, what money you will get back.


1200
02:17:27.877 --> 02:17:28.666
Mayank: Ha!


1201
02:17:28.897 --> 02:17:30.706
Mayank: Plus, it is lifetime as well.


1202
02:17:32.027 --> 02:17:39.657
Mayank: Shrisht, what money you will get back if we are not asking you not to spend any money? See, I could give you a coupon code for 2000 as well, but I'm giving you for free one.


1203
02:17:40.416 --> 02:17:41.416
Mayank: So, yes.


1204
02:17:42.756 --> 02:17:48.716
Mayank: Cool, everyone, as I said just last time I'm sharing, please make sure that you also go to the course, right now.


1205
02:17:48.897 --> 02:17:54.116
Mayank: And meanwhile, you also give the rating, okay? So there's a lever rating button. Please make sure that you leave a rating.


1206
02:17:54.317 --> 02:17:57.757
Mayank: 5-star, I think, nothing less than 5-star. That will be helpful, okay?


1207
02:18:02.537 --> 02:18:15.986
Mayank: Great. And don't worry, I will be coming up with more courses for all of you. As I said, I have reached out to you, Demi, so that this batch, people are starting from scratch, it will be very, very easy for all of you, okay? Things which we might not be covering on this course, I will make sure… we will make sure that we can give you coupons for that.


1208
02:18:17.086 --> 02:18:31.777
Mayank: Folks want to start earning from Damon, that's a problem. I will not be, like, let's say wrong here, like, selling a dream. You have to see the course and spend time, okay? And in the course as well, I keep it very honest. I'm not saying that, hey, buy this course and you will earn lakhs, no.


1209
02:18:32.377 --> 02:18:35.917
Mayank: Baraji, as of now, again, this course is only free, so yeah, just wait.


1210
02:18:36.087 --> 02:18:40.737
Mayank: If I give you 10 courses, you will even not be taking any advantage, right? So please first see this course.


1211
02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:46.707
Mayank: Sure. Cool, Monocal, I think if nothing else is there, we can add, so yeah.


1212
02:18:46.837 --> 02:18:49.277
Monal S: Yes, yes, can you make me a co-host?


1213
02:18:49.277 --> 02:18:53.036
Mayank: Oh, sorry, sorry, my bad, I will try to make a course host only.


1214
02:18:57.017 --> 02:19:00.436
Mayank: Nikhil, go to my YouTube channel, there I have shared my agency experience, okay?


1215
02:19:02.077 --> 02:19:05.397
Monal S: Alright guys, I hope everyone has fared the poll as well.


1216
02:19:06.747 --> 02:19:07.916
Monal S: I'm ending the poll.


1217
02:19:10.517 --> 02:19:20.746
Mayank: And on the poll as well, everyone, I'm pretty sure it will be 555, so do make sure that you do that. Okay, don't be lazy in that. We, as mentors, put a lot of effort, like, I think it's 1048.


1218
02:19:20.887 --> 02:19:24.527
Mayank: And you can see that how we are still open, giving you things and everything.


1219
02:19:24.747 --> 02:19:36.167
Mayank: So, yeah, just, if you have any genuine feedback, we are open for that, but if you like the class, instead of leaving, do leave 555, because it's very motivating for us mentors, okay? Don't be lazy there, like, yeah, everything I liked, so no.


1220
02:19:36.387 --> 02:19:38.397
Mayank: It's the least I think we can do, right?


1221
02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:54.476
Monal S: Alright guys, for any queries or something, whoever wants to drop off, they can drop off, we are also ending the session. And Wednesday, guys, Wednesday class, we already know what is expected from the Wednesday classes. It's two hours class.


1222
02:19:54.587 --> 02:20:00.327
Monal S: for increasing the speed, then every doubt till the last person will be covered in Saturday and Sunday.


1223
02:20:00.567 --> 02:20:03.937
Monal S: Alright? Even if it takes 7 hours, we will be there. Alright?


1224
02:20:04.467 --> 02:20:05.247
Monal S: Sure.


1225
02:20:05.387 --> 02:20:09.807
Monal S: All right, guys, that's all for this session, and see you guys. Bye-bye, good night.


1226
02:20:10.307 --> 02:20:14.177
Mayank: Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. Thanks, everyone. Please take the advantage, okay? Bye-bye.
